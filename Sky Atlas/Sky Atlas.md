# A.0 - Atlas Preamble [Scope]  <!-- UUID: 8650a584-01f8-45d6-882b-c14eab9879c4 -->

This Preamble will be further populated in later iterations of the Atlas.

## A.0.1 - Atlas Preamble [Article]  <!-- UUID: 56b15d7d-cdd4-4594-bd95-4f094564ac04 -->

This Article contains definitions and general provisions that should be inherited as essential context for the Atlas as a whole.

### A.0.1.1 - Definitions [Section]  <!-- UUID: c7d62f28-1d64-4632-8cd8-4f2b44c51bba -->

This Section contains essential definitions that are to be inherited as context for all Atlas documents.

#### A.0.1.1.1 - Organizational Alignment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4f6fda1e-7450-4065-8095-e93cb10b3a2a -->

Organizational alignment is a traditional business concept and can be described as the process of implementing strategies and philosophies to ensure that each member of an organization, from entry-level positions to executive managers, shares a common goal and vision for the success of an organization.

#### A.0.1.1.2 - Ecosystem Intelligence [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5e2e1397-ff87-43ce-a742-e5a68dc89a44 -->

"Ecosystem Intelligence" characterizes a decentralized ecosystem as a single entity acting with a greater or lesser amount of intelligence. Ecosystem Intelligence is not merely determined by the sum of the intelligence of each of its constituent parts, but rather the alignment of these parts. Counterintuitively, very intelligent, but spiritually misaligned participants in a decentralized ecosystem will actually lower Ecosystem Intelligence.

#### A.0.1.1.3 - Aligned Structure [Core]  <!-- UUID: fad68392-c852-4102-81fd-2a4037be38f9 -->

An aligned structure is a network, ecosystem, entity, or organization that actively employs Alignment Engineering.

#### A.0.1.1.4 - Universal Alignment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9f953b73-566e-4428-a9d2-e179513c3371 -->

Universal Alignment refers to an actor's holistic understanding of their connection to their environment or context. This enables them to anticipate how their actions influence everything around them, including the second-order effects that impact them in return. This holistic understanding is rooted in the context of human morality, values, and the natural world. An actor who is universally aligned can grasp the intent behind universally aligned rules and identify discrepancies between the technical incentives of rules and their universal purpose. An action that is in opposition to Universal Alignment constitutes misalignment. Preventing misalignment is the fundamental objective of Alignment Engineering and Alignment Artifacts.

#### A.0.1.1.5 - Universal Alignment Assumption [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2ea378ee-9b12-4e09-9f42-0c6ec65ef33b -->

Universal Alignment is a spectrum, and actors are more or less Universally Aligned.

In theory, Universal Alignment is absolute, but in practice it cannot be measured deterministically and thus practically will always be subject to debate and changes over time. Alignment Engineering aims to minimize the degree that actors experience their own, and others’, Universal Alignment changing over time.

The Universal Alignment Assumption holds that the outcomes of Alignment Engineering - namely, the Alignment Artifacts or rules themselves - always have the spirit, or underlying intent, to serve human values and promote the public good within a specific context.

#### A.0.1.1.6 - Alignment Artifact Strength [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3b712852-26a9-4fb9-8a9a-ebf2332d3efa -->

The strength of an Alignment Artifact dictates the minimum level of Universal Alignment that an actor must possess in order to take actions that are universally aligned when interacting with the Artifact.

Alignment Artifact Strength is enhanced by ensuring that Ecosystem Intelligence evolves such that each actor’s self-interested incentives correspond as precisely as possible with requirements of Universal Alignment. This alignment minimizes the additional effort, or "inner incentive", that an actor must exert to overcome misalignment.

The stronger an Alignment Artifact, the less inner incentive that an actor need possess to take actions that are universally aligned.

#### A.0.1.1.7 - Inner Incentive [Core]  <!-- UUID: 102b11a3-9c8c-423e-bd5f-a0988048f11e -->

Inner incentive is the second-order incentive that a universally aligned actor uses to counteract the first-order (or self-interested) incentives that exist pre-Alignment Engineering or that arise from a misaligned structure.

#### A.0.1.1.8 - Alignment Engineering [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3caef1a5-8d59-4a00-846c-fc0f060b3f05 -->

Alignment Engineering is a philosophy of organizational design introduced through the Atlas. It aims to anchor internally sustainable Ecosystem Intelligence within Alignment Artifacts that embody recursive trends towards increased Alignment Artifact Strength over time.

#### A.0.1.1.9 - Letter Of The Rule Vs Spirit Of The Rule [Core]  <!-- UUID: ff16fd74-3a81-4cac-92b4-1208d4d9f337 -->

The distinction between the "letter of the rule" and the "spirit of the rule" refers to whether an individual interprets and follows a rule strictly based on its precise wording, or instead also considers its underlying intent or larger purpose. The Universal Alignment Assumption holds that the underlying intent of rules always aims to serve human values and promote public benefit within a given context.

A "letter of the rule" interpretation adheres strictly to the rule’s language, often exploiting ambiguities or loopholes to achieve a specific outcome. This approach allows the rule’s exact wording, even if flawed or misaligned with its goals, to dictate the result, particularly if it benefits the interpreter.

A "spirit of the rule" interpretation seeks to comprehend the rule’s true purpose and how it contributes to Universal Alignment, while remaining bound by the letter of the rule. When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule’s language, this approach appeals to a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.

Example:

Imagine a large corporation discovers a loophole in the environmental regulation of its jurisdiction that allows them to generate profits by using a specific type of pollutant that isn’t regulated as a greenhouse gas, but is as harmful as regulated greenhouse gasses.

By exploiting the "letter of the rule," the corporation complies with the regulations on paper but continues to harm the environment and public health in practice.

A universally aligned actor, such as an environmentally conscious competitor, would interpret the regulations based on their "spirit" or underlying purpose — protecting the environment and public health. Recognizing that exploiting the loophole contradicts the regulations’ intent, the universally aligned actor would voluntarily choose not to emit the harmful pollutant, even though doing so might be profitable and technically legal. A universally aligned actor would also actively work with the government and other stakeholders to close the loophole and strengthen the regulations to ensure that they effectively serve their intended purpose, and to protect themselves from misaligned competitors.

#### A.0.1.1.10 - Incentivized Alignment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2fc27ce9-6f40-4ed5-934c-97189ea5301b -->

Incentivized Alignment is the outcome of an actor’s myopic and self-interested following of the letter of the rule with the first-order incentives of an Aligned Structure, but is not likely to be inherently Universally Aligned and lacks Inner Incentive.

#### A.0.1.1.11 - Misalignment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 60066e0f-3db7-45c7-9664-8120a4fbd38b -->

Misalignment characterizes the state in which an actor does not possess Universal Alignment, or acts in a way that opposes or contradicts Universal Alignment.

#### A.0.1.1.12 - Slippery Slope Misalignment [Core]  <!-- UUID: adf7ccb3-9ef0-43e0-90cc-6eb9d779f9cd -->

Slippery Slope Misalignment is the shortest path to misalignment where incremental misaligned acts are justified in various ways. These can include ignoring the potential significance and larger impact of acts due to their small scale; the trivial way that misalignment occurs; the good intentions of the actor; or the conviction that the ends justify the means.

Understanding Slippery Slope Misalignment means understanding that any misalignment at all is always very serious and, if not dealt with, results in increased risk of disequilibrium and alignment failure. In the context of a decentralized ecosystem such as Sky, this could mean a governance attack or financial collapse.

#### A.0.1.1.13 - Scope [Core]  <!-- UUID: f30e56f9-da71-44bc-ab3b-9b13348794fe -->

A Scope is a particular focus area of Sky. There are six Scopes:

- The Governance Scope focuses on Alignment Artifact interpretation and balance of powers.

- The Support Scope focuses on ecosystem support, tools, and activities, including the Sky Primitives.

- The Stability Scope focuses on financial stability and the core USDS Stablecoin product.

- The Protocol Scope focuses on technical development, maintenance, and security.

- The Accessibility Scope focuses on frontends and distribution.

- The Agent Scope contains all Agent Artifacts.

#### A.0.1.1.14 - Alignment Artifact [Core]  <!-- UUID: 551885ea-d851-4b76-afa1-5ea57f724c9a -->

Alignment Artifacts are outputs of Alignment Engineering, and can be used by universally aligned actors to coordinate to achieve a positive-sum outcome.

#### A.0.1.1.15 - Scope Alignment Artifact (Scope Artifact) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 10cb8335-18e3-466e-9a0a-b076c1719de5 -->

A Scope Artifact is an Alignment Artifact designed to align the actions and incentives of participants within a specific Scope defined by the Atlas. It provides a framework for decision-making, resource allocation, and governance within the defined Scope.

Each Scope has its own unique set of challenges and objectives that require a tailored approach to alignment.

The strength of a Scope Alignment Artifact depends on how well it aligns with Universal Alignment principles, as well as how effectively it is communicated and understood by participants within the defined Scope. A strong Scope Artifact can help prevent misalignment and ensure that all participants are working towards a common goal for the benefit of the entire ecosystem.

Scope Artifacts must not be changed beyond the Scope boundaries defined by the Atlas; this constitutes Slippery Slope Misalignment.

#### A.0.1.1.16 - The Atlas [Core]  <!-- UUID: 98223867-c60a-4b28-9401-94fc1ed9b4cd -->

The Atlas is the foundational set of rules powering Sky Ecosystem. It consists of Immutable Documents and Adaptive Documents. The former enshrine the Spirit of the Atlas and become permanently immutable from the moment the Sky Ecosystem enters the Endgame State. The Adaptive Documents practically operationalize the Spirit of the Atlas and will be continuously improved through the Sky Governance process. The Immutable part of the Atlas ensures the aligned evolution of Sky: it mitigates the potential and actual damage caused by Slippery Slope Misalignment, which erodes the potency of Alignment Engineering over time.

#### A.0.1.1.17 - Alignment Conserver (AC) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 94a451ce-100c-4ff5-8d53-65953938ecde -->

Alignment Conservers (ACs) are external entities that play a fundamental role in facilitating and protecting the Sky Governance process by ensuring it occurs according to the processes defined in the Atlas. ACs enable SKY holders to participate in Sky Governance in a manner where it is easy for SKY holders to make the decisions that best benefit their long-term interests as SKY holders, even if SKY holders overall have relatively little alignment.

#### A.0.1.1.18 - Aligned Delegate (AD) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8ea04ed4-7075-45e6-b6ed-a52b7506f4a8 -->

Aligned Delegates (ADs) are anonymous Alignment Conservers that use Delegate Contracts to enable SKY holders to easily and safely delegate their SKY voting power.

Because they directly control large amounts of incentivized SKY voting power, ADs are both highly influential and potentially risky actors within the governance framework. The Atlas empowers ADs and other Ecosystem Actors with the tools to derisk ADs’ influence in the ecosystem.

The primary responsibility of ADs is to use their delegated power to uphold the Spirit of the Atlas and maintain Universal Alignment of the Sky Ecosystem. ADs are subject to strict requirements enforced by the Governance Scope.

#### A.0.1.1.19 - Facilitator [Core]  <!-- UUID: 912e0161-3448-470f-9cf6-d1a26d76acab -->

Facilitators are anonymous Alignment Conservers with responsibility over specific Scopes. Facilitators can directly access governance processes and smart contracts to fulfill their responsibilities.

#### A.0.1.1.20 - Communication Channel [Core]  <!-- UUID: 72e08874-de00-40dd-aa2b-be76ff754902 -->

Communication Channels are a critical consideration in the Atlas as they have a significant impact on incentivized alignment.

#### A.0.1.1.21 - Governance Scope (GOV) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 72f9b4d1-695b-489c-a060-db0013ba0466 -->

The Governance Scope Alignment Artifact codifies rules that regulate the critical balance-of-power processes defined in the Atlas, and adjudicate on appeals processes related to misalignment in the ecosystem.

#### A.0.1.1.22 - Support Scope (SUP) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 334492f3-db84-4f8b-9593-93cefe72900a -->

The Support Scope Alignment Artifact codifies rules that regulate various tasks of ecosystem support, including governance process infrastructure and management and Agent ecosystem support.

#### A.0.1.1.23 - Protocol Scope (PRO) [Core]  <!-- UUID: b24446c1-44d2-408a-9077-d397fa173132 -->

The Protocol Scope Alignment Artifact codifies rules related to the core technical Sky protocol.

#### A.0.1.1.24 - Stability Scope (STA) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6a900766-15ff-49b1-bed5-59f58b9c49c7 -->

The Stability Scope Alignment Artifact codifies the rules related to managing the core Stablecoin product, USDS, and supporting factors related to financial stability, such as surplus buffer and decentralized asset reserve.

#### A.0.1.1.25 - Accessibility Scope (ACC) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1109f780-d48a-4712-8106-848952b684a4 -->

The Accessibility Scope defines rules related to accessibility and distribution efforts and regulates user-facing frontends.

#### A.0.1.1.26 - Governance Equilibrium [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7e629109-1d84-46da-a986-94036be81e93 -->

A Governance Equilibrium is a state in a Decentralized Governance dynamic where the governance process is able to remain decentralized over time with a very high degree of confidence. It requires redundant feedback loops that can counteract the natural incentives that push the governance process towards disequilibrium and centralization.

#### A.0.1.1.27 - Endgame State [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8a57b601-aec4-49dc-bf34-383c63da11de -->

Endgame State is the final technical and alignment engineering state of Sky, in which all aspects of the ecosystem that can be made immutable, have been made immutable. The aim of the Endgame State is to create a highly resilient Governance Equilibrium.

#### A.0.1.1.28 - Explicit Incentives [Core]  <!-- UUID: a5a8a3e5-3d79-4c37-acce-4ac34a459cae -->

Explicit Incentives are the first-order incentives that are coded into rules in Alignment Artifacts.

#### A.0.1.1.29 - Implicit Incentives [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2c824e12-3ec1-4007-9294-ef15d25ccdca -->

Implicit Incentives are the motivations or benefits that an actor can infer based on a ‘letter of the rules’ interpretation of an Alignment Artifact, and an assessment of the likelihood that these rules will be enforced.

#### A.0.1.1.30 - Incentive Slack [Core]  <!-- UUID: 133c6032-0082-4644-a3d5-87bcf5b30249 -->

Incentive Slack refers to the discrepancy between the explicit incentives (those clearly defined and communicated) and the implicit incentives (those inferred by actors) within an Aligned Structure. Incentive Slack can arise when coded rules are either not enforced or are too restrictive or impractical, leading to a pattern of bypassing these rules. When Incentive Slack is high, it creates the perception that rules are likely to be ignored, without regard for the spirit of the rules. This results in a significant risk of widespread misalignment. Incentive Slack cannot occur in an Aligned Structure in which actors are universally aligned and actively enforcing the rules.

#### A.0.1.1.31 - Whole Weeks [Core]  <!-- UUID: 20f8b661-37c0-4d16-9238-d9595bbcb4cf -->

The Atlas defines quarterly and yearly cycles that determine fixed points in time by counting whole weeks from the beginning of a quarter. The first whole week of a quarter is defined as the first week in which all days, beginning with Monday, fall within the quarter. Another definition would be "the week starting with the first Monday of the quarter."

#### A.0.1.1.32 - SKY Staking [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6a2c7245-8d67-4de0-80af-ce953352e1bb -->

When a user stakes their SKY tokens, they receive Staking Rewards. Staked SKY can be freely unstaked at any time. SKY Staking also allows users to borrow USDS against their SKY at the SKY Borrow Rate.

#### A.0.1.1.33 - Skylink [Core]  <!-- UUID: f0de89da-576a-4710-982e-40acf7f065cc -->

Skylink is the Sky Ecosystem’s multichain solution, connecting USDS, SKY and other Sky Ecosystem tokens from the Ethereum Mainnet to other chains and L2 protocols. Skylink will make all core Sky features available on the chains and L2s it is deployed to, including Native USDS; Native Sky Savings Rate; Native Token Rewards and Native 1:1 conversion between USDC and USDS.

#### A.0.1.1.34 - Target Document [Core]  <!-- UUID: 575ab954-d26c-460e-8a11-ebe7f5586dff -->

The term "Target Document" refers to the Immutable or Primary Document to which a Supporting Document is attached. Supporting Documents have various functions, including providing expanded definitions of vague or ambiguous terms in their Target Document; and providing hypothetical fact-patterns to illustrate the practical application of their Target Document. See [A.1.2.2.1.3 - Supporting Document Category](e87b6850-3792-495d-9460-0ac069a217e6).

#### A.0.1.1.35 - Voting Power [Core]  <!-- UUID: 44221aff-ad7c-41d3-a861-8a30963054fa -->

"Voting Power" denotes the ability of Aligned Delegates to vote on Sky governance decisions on behalf of a SKY holder. SKY holders can delegate their Voting Power to an Aligned Delegate through Delegate Contracts, allowing the Aligned Delegate to vote on their behalf while the SKY holders retain control of their tokens.

#### A.0.1.1.36 - stUSDS [Core]  <!-- UUID: 591e1ba4-1f3e-44ac-9f4c-3f5d680f33d4 -->

The token used to provide the capital for SKY Staking leverage is called stUSDS. It ensures that all SKY-backed borrowing is funded by segregated risk capital. Users can deposit USDS into a smart contract and receive stUSDS, which can later be converted back to USDS as long as there is unutilized USDS in the stUSDS converter smart contract.

#### A.0.1.1.37 - Unrewarded USDS [Core]  <!-- UUID: 86977920-c857-4a86-91ac-1a7571137c18 -->

Unrewarded USDS are USDS balances that are not receiving the Sky Savings Rate, Integration Boost or USDS Token Rewards. USDS Token Rewards include both SKY and Agent token rewards.

#### A.0.1.1.38 - Sky Forum [Core]  <!-- UUID: e78e8fbb-0602-4e67-8c44-88b1f0b30704 -->

The Sky Forum serves as a dedicated platform for governance across the Sky Ecosystem. Community members submit proposals, engage in debate, and align on decisions. Posts are organized by category according to subject matter. For example, proposals or discussions concerning Sky Core must use the "Sky Core" category, while those pertaining to Primes must use the Prime category associated with the Agent. Authors should also apply relevant tags to improve discoverability and cross-referencing. The forum is located at [https://forum.sky.money/](https://forum.sky.money/).

#### A.0.1.1.39 - Agent [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3c18e6a7-95b8-44e9-8da6-1eadf3fdd356 -->

Agents are first-class economic citizens of Sky that autonomously pursue business opportunities. Each Agent has its own Agent Artifact and token. Initially, the creation of an Agent results in a Proto-Agent, which lacks any specialized role. To gain functionality within the Sky ecosystem, a Proto-Agent must deploy a special Transformation Primitive to transform into a specific Agent sub-type. The Agent sub-types currently defined in the Atlas include 1) Prime Agent and 2) Executor Agent, with the Executor Agent sub-type further divided into Operational Executor Agents and Core Executor Agents.

Although Executor Agents are not yet operational, the Atlas nonetheless defines the foundational rules, processes, and governance structures necessary for their eventual activation. In the medium to long term, these Executor Agents will become fully operative and perform an essential function in facilitating the activities of Prime Agents across the Sky ecosystem.

#### A.0.1.1.40 - Agent Artifact [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8d081c1a-6393-4aaf-8914-8959cdf2fee3 -->

Agent Artifacts contain all rules, processes, parameters, and knowledge of the Agent. Agent Artifacts must be aligned with, and are fully subordinate to, the Sky Core Atlas.

#### A.0.1.1.41 - Agent Scope [Core]  <!-- UUID: 87dafa99-c36e-4e68-ac19-fccac4b3834d -->

The Agent Scope codifies all Agent Artifacts.

#### A.0.1.1.42 - Prime Agent [Core]  <!-- UUID: a8454271-c090-4084-b022-4430e3def93c -->

Prime Agents maintain and automate Sky features in new markets, and innovate custom products. Prime Agents are the only Agent type that can access all Sky Primitives; whereas Executor Agents are limited in the Primitives they can access.

- Prime Agents cannot directly operationalize those elements of their strategies that directly interface with the Sky Protocol or shared ecosystem infrastructure. For such protocol-level and ecosystem-critical operations, Prime Agents must rely on Operational Executor Agents for implementation.

- When a Prime Agent formulates a new initiative, it encodes the relevant instructions and parameters into its Agent Artifact. Insofar as the Prime Agent’s Artifact requires protocol-level interactions, the Operational Executors use the Artifact as a detailed operational blueprint for implementing the Prime Agent’s directives—ensuring consistency with the Atlas and minimizing risk.

- This ensures a robust division between Prime Agents’ strategic, externally facing activities and the specialized operational activities that directly interface with Sky’s core systems.

#### A.0.1.1.43 - Executor Agent [Core]  <!-- UUID: ac514975-66ad-4b43-8f76-42cac5ca599d -->

Executor Agents ("Executors") are specialized Agents that implement those elements of a Prime Agent’s activities that directly interface with the Sky Protocol or shared ecosystem resources, leaving Prime Agents free to focus on strategic, business development, and marketing efforts. There are two Executor sub-types: Core Executor Agents ("Core Executor Agents") and Operational Executor Agents ("Operational Executors").

- Operational Executor Agents handle the day-to-day execution of those portions of a Prime Agent’s strategies that directly interface with the Sky Protocol, strictly following the instructions laid out in each Prime Agent’s Artifact. Prime Agents cannot be active in the Sky Ecosystem unless they have an active "Operational Executor Accord" which codifies their relationship with an Operational Executor. Operational Executors take on the risk of Prime Agents’ outcomes by providing collateralized insurance against losses or liabilities. Operational Executor Agents’ Operational Collateral can also cover losses from negligence or malicious behavior by the Operational Executor in carrying out the Prime Agent’s strategy.

- Core Executor Agents, on the other hand, oversee the activities of Operational Executors, ensuring that the implementation of Prime Agent strategies aligns with the Atlas.

- By separating strategy from operations, this division of labor empowers Prime Agents to innovate rapidly and expand their ventures without needing to develop specialized operational expertise, as Operational Executors manage the day-to-day technical implementation under the oversight of Core Executor Agents.

#### A.0.1.1.44 - Operational Executor Agent [Core]  <!-- UUID: 23253343-23e3-440f-90c0-43d3437c2098 -->

Operational Executor Agents ("Operational Executors") are specialized Executor Agents tasked with implementing and verifying those elements of a Prime Agent’s strategy that directly interface with the Sky Protocol or shared ecosystem resources. While Prime Agents autonomously set strategic direction, Operational Executors are responsible for operationalizing those activities that modify on-chain or protocol-level state, relying on the relevant Primitive Configuration Documents in the Agent Artifact.

Each Operational Executor Agent must comprise at least one Facilitator and at least one GovOps actor. Facilitators are responsible for interpreting the Atlas and the Agent Artifact and instructing GovOps actors to carry out the corresponding actions. To ensure accountability and mitigate potential risks, Operational Executor Agents must maintain Operational Collateral, which serves as a guarantee to cover losses or damages resulting from negligence or malicious behavior by either Facilitators or GovOps actors.

#### A.0.1.1.45 - Core Council Executor Agent [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2a440474-20d1-4703-a57b-35e0cebb881c -->

Core Council Executor Agents ("Core Executor Agents") are Executor Agents who serve on the Core Council and act as checks on Operational Executor Agents.

#### A.0.1.1.46 - Core Council [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5a03a0c4-a47a-409c-9b23-52ac93e63d45 -->

The Core Council is a group of Executors responsible for operationalizing the protocol at the Sky Core level. It monitors Operational Executor compliance and enforces the Sky Core Atlas. It also oversees Sky Core governance processes, evolves the Risk Framework, monitors Alignment Conservers, and addresses governance disputes. The Council begins with a single seat held by Core Council Executor Agent 1 and will expand over time to multiple elected seats on a rotational basis, targeting up to seven members in the long term.

#### A.0.1.1.47 - GovOps [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1e73ee4b-823d-406a-af54-223b43bc8e42 -->

Governance Operations ("GovOps") actors are specialized Ecosystem Actors operating within Executor Agent entities. They manage the technical implementation of Prime Agents’ Instances of Sky Primitives by carrying out on-chain/off-chain tasks necessary for Prime Agents’ operational and governance processes. They work in tandem with Executor Facilitators, who interpret the Atlas and the Agent Artifact.

#### A.0.1.1.48 - Operational Executor GovOps [Core]  <!-- UUID: 80c7e2e1-a2af-47dd-80c7-aee6823cca91 -->

Operational Executor GovOps ("Operational GovOps") actors are GovOps actors that operate within Operational Executor Agents. Operational GovOps play a crucial role in implementing Prime Agent strategies, doing so by executing the technical specifications outlined in Primitive Configuration Documents of Agent Artifacts.

#### A.0.1.1.49 - Core Council GovOps [Core]  <!-- UUID: e512e890-629f-450f-a14d-a3ea06a369c0 -->

Core Council GovOps ("Core GovOps") actors are GovOps actors that operate within Core Executor Agents.

#### A.0.1.1.50 - Operational Executor Facilitator [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2d984fe4-c1d7-4ac3-835b-19f19a3a5505 -->

Operational Executor Facilitators are Facilitators that interpret Artifacts and the Atlas on behalf of Operational Executor Agents.

#### A.0.1.1.51 - Core Council Executor Facilitator [Core]  <!-- UUID: 453e9bfb-2776-486d-b451-35742e49e0ab -->

Core Council Executor Facilitators ("Core Facilitator") interpret Artifacts and the Atlas on behalf of Core Executor Agents.

#### A.0.1.1.52 - Sky Primitives [Core]  <!-- UUID: ae14941a-635e-4022-af4d-2bec2827fbbf -->

Sky Primitives are the core building blocks of the Sky ecosystem, serving as the primary interface between Agents and the Atlas. By providing a standardized set of tools and interfaces, Sky Primitives empower Prime Agents to create, innovate, and evolve the Sky Protocol in a decentralized manner. The Sky Primitives are also used by Executor Agents, which serve as the robust and standardized intermediary layer between Prime Agents and the Sky Protocol.

### A.0.1.2 - General Provisions [Section]  <!-- UUID: b5c97151-07b9-4679-8896-478ccafa86b9 -->

This Section contains general provisions that are to be inherited as context for all Atlas documents.

#### A.0.1.2.1 - Facilitators’ Broad Discretionary Capacity [Core]  <!-- UUID: f18229fe-fbc3-4dc8-ad84-4bca2915f6c4 -->

The next-generation Atlas is a self-contained governance infrastructure powering the Sky Ecosystem. It is designed to grow in tandem with the adaptive intelligence of the Ecosystem. Yet these first iterations of the next-generation Atlas may not sufficiently account for the critical, unforeseen contingencies that can arise, particularly as the Protocol is in a dynamic period of evolution. 

To ensure the Ecosystem grows in resilience and advances toward the Endgame State, it must be able to respond quickly to pressing changes in its environment. To facilitate this, the Scope Facilitators are granted broad discretionary power, given their close proximity to, and knowledge of, the Sky Ecosystem. 

Where the Atlas does not provide clear guidance on a current challenge, Scope Facilitators are empowered to infer the Spirit of the Atlas in such a way as to maximize Universal Alignment and secure the Ecosystem’s growth, security and progression toward the Endgame State. 

Scope Facilitators also have the discretion to supersede existing Atlas provisions where they determine the latter to be unsuitable for current challenges. 

The discretionary power granted herein is temporary.

##### A.0.1.2.1.1 - Authorization To Run Bootstrapping Governance Poll [Core]  <!-- UUID: abd2a3e6-897c-4a2a-af5c-b06da3429912 -->

The Core Facilitator can run a Bootstrapping Governance Poll at any time to enable SKY holders to vote on needed changes to the Atlas. The Core Facilitator can do this on their own initiative.

Where feasible, the Core Facilitator is encouraged to run a Governance Poll to formalize actions taken pursuant to  [A.0.1.2.1 - Facilitators’ Broad Discretionary Capacity](f18229fe-fbc3-4dc8-ad84-4bca2915f6c4).

###### A.0.1.2.1.1.0.3.1 - Formalize Actions - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: b62f852c-db59-4bf8-a72c-0b825961563d -->

Facilitators have broad discretionary authority to interpret or supersede the Atlas pursuant to [A.0.1.2.1 - Facilitators’ Broad Discretionary Capacity](f18229fe-fbc3-4dc8-ad84-4bca2915f6c4). 

The element "formalize actions" pertains to the recommendation that Scope Facilitators, where feasible, conduct Governance Polls to officially ratify changes in the Atlas that correspond to the actions they have undertaken based on the aforementioned document.

For example, if a Scope Facilitator decides to supersede a particular Atlas document due to its inadequacy in addressing a specific challenge, the Facilitator is encouraged to initiate a Governance Poll to allow SKY holders to vote on a revised version of the document that corrects the identified shortcomings.

###### A.0.1.2.1.1.0.3.2 - Where Feasible - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 50a8c7e5-9305-487b-adc2-d05d742e5227 -->

This element "where feasible" introduces a degree of flexibility or discretion. It indicates that Scope Facilitators are encouraged to run Governance Polls in the context of the Target Document when it is possible, practical or appropriate to do so.

###### A.0.1.2.1.1.0.4.1 - Determination Of Feasibility Is Itself At The Discretion of Facilitators [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 4dd8de6f-0593-4d2b-afcd-2460e63fe22b -->

The determination of feasibility may depend on factors such as time constraints, resource availability, or the urgency of the decision. The determination of feasibility is itself at the discretion of the Facilitators.

###### A.0.1.2.1.1.0.4.2 - Formalizing actions via Governance Poll is encouraged, but not mandatory [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: a8d562d8-f9ba-4cee-973e-0526cfca439b -->

If the Core Facilitator decides to supersede a particular Atlas document due to its inadequacy in addressing a specific challenge, the Facilitator is encouraged, though not required, to initiate a Governance Poll to allow SKY holders to vote on a revised version of the document that corrects the identified shortcomings. The Target Document does not require Facilitators to run a Governance Poll to formalize their actions.

Similarly, if a Facilitator identifies a gap in the Atlas where a particular need is not explicitly addressed, they may extrapolate a course of action based on their interpretation of the Spirit of the Atlas. In this case, as well, the Target Document does not require Facilitators to run a Governance Poll to formalize their interpretation or extrapolated actions.

This Action Tenet acknowledges the necessity for Facilitators to possess flexible and broad discretionary authority during the early stages of the Atlas' development. Such flexibility ensures that the ecosystem can swiftly adapt to emerging challenges. Consequently, it is important at this stage to avoid over-formalizing actions and decisions taken by Facilitators pursuant to [A.0.1.2.1 - Facilitators’ Broad Discretionary Capacity](f18229fe-fbc3-4dc8-ad84-4bca2915f6c4).

##### A.0.1.2.1.2 - Precedence Over Conflicting Provisions [Core]  <!-- UUID: fe58827d-5a02-4b84-bd56-8e5d93ef8f48 -->

The broad interpretive and discretionary capacity granted Facilitators by [A.0.1.2.1.2 - Precedence Over Conflicting Provisions](fe58827d-5a02-4b84-bd56-8e5d93ef8f48) takes precedence over any conflicting provisions in the Atlas.

# A.1 - The Governance Scope [Scope]  <!-- UUID: 18ac7dd3-c646-4352-9b0d-d01a2932d7d1 -->

The Governance Scope regulates the governance processes and balance of power of the Sky Ecosystem. The Governance Scope must ensure that the resilient equilibrium of Sky Governance remains protected against all potential direct and indirect threats.

## A.1.1 - Spirit of the Atlas [Article]  <!-- UUID: 86a93dab-2f12-4c3f-9285-bcc4520c851b -->

The Spirit of the Atlas represents the foundational principles of Sky Governance. The Spirit of the Atlas is enshrined in the Immutable Documents, reflected in the Atlas as a whole and enacted by aligned participants of the Sky Ecosystem.

### A.1.1.1 - Universal Alignment And The Spirit Of The Atlas [Section]  <!-- UUID: 9524005e-e135-4ba5-aff3-d846923f3874 -->

The guiding principles of the Sky Ecosystem, known as the Spirit of the Atlas, form the foundation of the Sky Governance process. These principles are enshrined in the Immutable Documents of the Atlas, enabling coordination around a resilient governance equilibrium that optimizes for Universal Alignment between the ecosystem and its environment. The Immutable Documents take precedence over any other rules, decisions, or governance structures that may conflict with them. The Immutable Documents provide the definitive criteria for determining whether the Sky Ecosystem's rules and incentives are in harmony with Universal Alignment.

### A.1.1.2 - Interpretation Of The Spirit Of The Atlas [Section]  <!-- UUID: f1b305d3-b4a1-4b00-85fa-6dec8e995e42 -->

Where the Immutable Documents do not contain explicit instructions about a particular topic, the Spirit of the Atlas should be extrapolated to maximize Universal Alignment and mitigate risks of slippery slope misalignment. Atlas Interpretations must be fully congruent with the Spirit of the Atlas and established precedent. Further, each Atlas Interpretation must set a clear precedent to avoid future ambiguities that could impede effective governance.

#### A.1.1.2.1 - General Principles [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7c921d71-b4fe-4bb7-a58b-c57955de2148 -->

Scope Facilitators are authorized to conduct Atlas Interpretations to address and resolve ambiguities or contradictions within Atlas Documents. These interpretations may include providing expanded definitions for problematic terms, clarifying the practical application of specific rules or logic, and similar actions aimed at resolving uncertainties. Pursuant to [A.0.1.2.1 - Facilitators’ Broad Discretionary Capacity](f18229fe-fbc3-4dc8-ad84-4bca2915f6c4), the Facilitators have broad discretion in conducting Atlas Interpretations.

All Atlas Interpretations must be documented to establish clear precedent that reflects the Spirit of the Atlas and guides future interpretations.

##### A.1.1.2.1.0.3.1 - Ambiguity - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 2e15db4f-09cb-40e5-aaf2-172ac8da08a9 -->

The element "ambiguity" refers to instances where the language of an Atlas document allows for multiple possible interpretations.

##### A.1.1.2.1.0.3.2 - Contradictions - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: e7d8a884-de5c-416b-b297-2ac73ad0588e -->

The element "contradictions" refers to instances where different Atlas documents conflict with one another, leading to confusion or inconsistency in their application.

##### A.1.1.2.1.0.3.3 - Expanded Definitions - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 3c070432-e2d7-4965-954b-7736f000c919 -->

The element "expanded definitions" describes the process of providing more detailed or comprehensive explanations of terms that are vague, overly broad, or otherwise unclear. Such expanded definitions can be codified in the Element Annotation Document Type. See [A.1.2.2.2.10 - The Element Annotation Type](71db0980-a49f-4d48-b277-87f9a2340a8f).

##### A.1.1.2.1.0.3.4 - Precedent - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 011f56bd-88ea-4349-bb58-32d2f6ba32e4 -->

The element "precedent" refers to the established examples or standards set by documented Atlas Interpretations, which guide future decision-making and interpretations. Atlas Interpretations can be codified in the Facilitator Action Precedent Document Type. See [A.1.2.2.2.14 - The Facilitator Action Precedent Type](7323b3c5-ffd3-4f8f-af51-5d176531dd0f).

#### A.1.1.2.0.3.1 - Extrapolated - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 453cd0ba-534c-45b3-8cb2-0154e579c3cd -->

The element "extrapolated" refers to the process by which a Facilitator has inferred or deduced from their understanding of the Spirit of the Atlas a necessary course of action when explicit guidance is not available. This inferred action is also based on the Facilitator’s current state of Universal Alignment.

#### A.1.1.2.0.3.2 - Slippery Slope Misalignment - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: dce17e05-293a-4779-a028-ad32701aacd1 -->

The element "slippery slope misalignment" refers to the potential for incremental deviations from Sky’s core principles to gradually lead to significant and undesirable shifts, ultimately steering the Ecosystem away from its intended purpose and vision.

### A.1.1.3 - List Of Interpretations [Section]  <!-- UUID: 55626fc2-3108-4caf-b241-2b215eb75d18 -->

This Section contains a list of all settled Atlas interpretations with all necessary context.

#### A.1.1.3.1 - Atlas Interpretations [Active Data Controller]  <!-- UUID: c3c7c96c-d756-4e54-a5c5-79b5970394e0 -->

Atlas Interpretation precedent is defined as Active Data in [A.1.1.3.1.0.6.1 - List Of Atlas Interpretations](88df9622-0dd5-4035-83fb-9866a66eadf2). 

The Active Data is updated as follows:

- The Responsible Party is the Core Facilitator.

- The Update Process must follow the protocol for ‘Direct Edit’.

##### A.1.1.3.1.0.6.1 - List Of Atlas Interpretations [Active Data]  <!-- UUID: 88df9622-0dd5-4035-83fb-9866a66eadf2 -->

List of Atlas Interpretations:

- Payments denominated in SKY in the Atlas will be made in MKR prior to the launch of SKY at the proscribed conversion rate listed in the Atlas.

### A.1.1.0.3.1 - Foundational Principles - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: ac6a31ff-b844-4dc8-b9d6-bf629f34698c -->

The element "foundational principles" indicates the primary or essential rules, policies and objectives that serve as the groundwork for Sky Governance. To avoid ambiguity or slippery slope misalignment, these foundational principles must be specifically defined to the furthest extent possible in the Immutable Documents, as they are the base upon which the Adaptive Documents are built.

### A.1.1.0.3.2 - Spirit of the Atlas - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 6b0d739f-f957-46fc-85ad-32ade8144249 -->

The element "Spirit of the Atlas" refers to the guiding principles that form the ethical, philosophical and operational foundation of the Sky ecosystem. This element should be understood as encompassing the core ideals and objectives influencing the governance, and thus the evolution, of Sky Ecosystem. 

The Spirit of the Atlas should be specified to the furthest extent possible in the Immutable Documents. The Spirit of the Atlas is continually evolving in response to internal and external stimuli; and thus reflects the adaptive intelligence of the Sky ecosystem as a whole. Once the Endgame State is reached and the Immutable Documents are forever locked down, the Spirit of the Atlas will continue to evolve through the vehicle of the Adaptive Documents. 

See also, [A.0.1.1.16 - The Atlas](98223867-c60a-4b28-9401-94fc1ed9b4cd) and [A.0.1.1.9 - Letter Of The Rule Vs Spirit Of The Rule](ff16fd74-3a81-4cac-92b4-1208d4d9f337).

## A.1.2 - Atlas Documents [Article]  <!-- UUID: fbd55373-32cc-49a9-a74d-60cfacf6a379 -->

Atlas Documents are essential to the structure and governance of the Sky Ecosystem. They are organized into document trees, which include Immutable Documents and Adaptive Documents. Immutable Documents embody the Spirit of the Atlas; while Adaptive Documents operationalize the Spirit of the Atlas and facilitate its aligned evolution. This Article defines the properties, development, and procedures associated with Atlas Documents.

### A.1.2.1 - Definition And Properties Of Atlas Documents [Section]  <!-- UUID: b2e65d2d-2925-4f81-9cb6-b23c6d2fca02 -->

Atlas Documents are the basic building blocks for structuring data in the Atlas. They are organized as nested document trees, each with a unique Document Identifier. 

The first three layers contain the Immutable Documents, which together enshrine the Spirit of the Atlas and the core, permanent boundaries for how to operationalize it without risking slippery slope misalignment. 

In the layers below the Immutable Documents are the Adaptive Documents, which are continuously improved through the Sky Governance process. The Adaptive Documents interpret and practically operationalize the Spirit of the Atlas within the boundaries set by the Immutable Documents.

#### A.1.2.1.1 - Document Identifiers [Core]  <!-- UUID: af7c725e-06c9-4c48-ac8a-c979eb004456 -->

All Atlas Documents are distinguishable through their unique Document Identifier. The Document Identifier is the technical name of the Atlas Document, and it determines its position in the Document Tree of the Atlas. All Document Identifiers begin with a capital A, and the numbers and letters of the Document Identifiers are separated with dots, with each dot signifying that the Atlas Document is one layer deeper in the tree structure. The Document Identifiers help determine the position of each Atlas Document, and makes it easier to estimate the relationship between two different Atlas Documents.

##### A.1.2.1.1.1 - Early Atlas Iteration Bootstrapping [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7aeb8c0d-d5b3-4f3c-954a-a0f734995425 -->

In the first iterations of the Atlas, formal Atlas Document Identifiers will not yet be implemented for all Document Types.

#### A.1.2.1.2 - Atlas Document Properties [Core]  <!-- UUID: faa87541-e10b-4d99-822d-4877e20bc9d4 -->

All Atlas Documents have five (5) standard properties that provide key information about them. The subdocuments of this document specify the characteristics of each of the five (5) standard properties.

The standard properties of Atlas Documents should be listed in the following order:

1. Name

2. Version

3. Last Modified

4. Type

5. Components

##### A.1.2.1.2.1 - Name Property [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4cb85e3a-f73f-4918-a90c-020a479af7d2 -->

The Name property is assigned to each Atlas Document to provide a human-readable name, making it easier for humans to identify the document and understand its purpose and function at a glance. This Name serves as an abstracted overview of the document's content, distinguishing it from other documents in a user-friendly manner.

However, for data management and record-keeping purposes, the official designation of an Atlas Document is its unique Document Identifier. As a result, the Name property can be modified with no substantive consequences.

##### A.1.2.1.2.2 - Version Property [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3263a17d-44ab-4450-af61-d797fa0c8ac7 -->

The Version property of Atlas Documents specifies how many times it has been modified. Every time an Atlas Document is modified, the newly modified Document gets its version number incremented, and the old version is recorded as a historical version with a Document Identifier equivalent to its version number. 

As an example, if an Atlas Document located at 1.1.1 with version number 3 is modified, the new Atlas Document will have version number 4, and the old Atlas Document will be located at 1.1.1.v3. 

This ensures all historical versions of Atlas documents are retained permanently as a part of the Atlas.

##### A.1.2.1.2.3 - Last Modified Property [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1a9961c4-856a-4c48-bc48-8da4e4a26dd4 -->

The Last Modified property specifies the exact date and time when the Atlas Document was updated to its current version. It is recorded in the UTC timezone and follows the format 'YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS'. This property provides a timestamp for tracking modifications and ensuring transparency in the governance and update process. When an Atlas Document is at version 1, the Last Modified property denotes when the Atlas Document was created.

##### A.1.2.1.2.4 - Type Property [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8f6dd2df-599f-4fcc-803d-1e1cc5adcdcd -->

The Type property of Atlas Documents specifies the function, characteristic and purpose of the Atlas Document. The Type determines the data that must be contained in the Components Property. The various Document Types and their characteristics are specified in [A.1.2.2 - Structure, Categories, And Types Of Atlas Documents](f65c083f-021b-4a12-b000-6764e4fe28c3).

##### A.1.2.1.2.5 - Components Property [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6ae438cd-3678-46a2-b323-1f44204b5759 -->

The Components property of Atlas Documents contains an object that specifies the data components of the Atlas Document as nested properties. The Components of an Atlas Document is determined by its Type. Some Document Types have no Components, in which the object is just empty. 

An Atlas Document with Components must always have all of its components properly filled according to the requirements defined by its Type Specification. Some documents have custom logic for how their Components behave, and this custom logic is specified through a special reserved component property called 'Custom'. Atlas Documents of Types with specified custom logic components can have variable number of components, and different characteristics of each component, for each instance of the Type. Custom components are always appended to the end of the list of components.

#### A.1.2.1.0.3.1 - Nested Document Trees - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: f0b99ed7-9f30-4948-be39-146c3d2b83d2 -->

The element "nested document trees" refers to the hierarchical organization of Atlas documents, where each document is part of a larger structure with parent and child relationships. Higher-level documents govern or influence the interpretation and application of lower-level documents.

### A.1.2.2 - Structure, Categories, And Types Of Atlas Documents [Section]  <!-- UUID: f65c083f-021b-4a12-b000-6764e4fe28c3 -->

This Section defines the basic structure of Atlas Documents and their specifications, including their general categories and individual types, their syntax and content requirements, and their functions and composability in the Atlas.

#### A.1.2.2.1 - Atlas Document Type Categories [Core]  <!-- UUID: c74cc05e-be2d-4b83-83f4-21bfe113be33 -->

The Atlas Document Types can be broadly categorized into distinct groups that determine how they are modified and how they function in the Atlas. At the highest level there are the Immutable Documents and the Adaptive Documents. The Adaptive Documents are further subdivided into three (3) distinct groups: Primary Documents, Supporting Documents, and Accessory Documents. The category of an Atlas Document can be inferred from its Document Identifier, as each group has unique and non-overlapping rules for validity of their Document Identifiers.

##### A.1.2.2.1.1 - Immutable Document Category [Core]  <!-- UUID: a324e17e-56c9-4d35-b4fa-75593d852f15 -->

Immutable Documents are the most important part of the Atlas: they record the Spirit of the Atlas, detailing the vision, purpose and unalienable principles of Sky. In the transition to Endgame State, Immutable documents remain modifiable by the governance processes specified elsewhere in the Atlas. Once the Endgame State has been reached, however, Immutable Documents become fully immutable, i.e., they can never be changed. Immutable Documents have Document identifiers that are at most three (3) layers deep in the Document Tree.

##### A.1.2.2.1.2 - Primary Document Category [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7de56365-7762-4bba-b982-04c9ec6582e0 -->

Primary Documents are the cornerstone of the Adaptive Documents and ensure the practical operationalization and resilience of the Atlas. They detail specific, practical principles, rules, processes and roles necessary to operationalize the Spirit of the Atlas. In the transition to Endgame, Primary Documents can be modified with no restrictions, using the governance processes specified elsewhere in the Atlas. Once the Endgame State is reached, Primary Documents generally must be modified as slowly as possible, and as little as possible while remaining fully adapted to the external environment. Primary Documents have Document Identifiers that are 4 layers or deeper in the Document Tree, and cannot contain 0's.

##### A.1.2.2.1.3 - Supporting Document Category [Core]  <!-- UUID: e87b6850-3792-495d-9460-0ac069a217e6 -->

Supporting Documents are attached to Immutable Documents and Primary Documents (called their "Target Document"). They provide context and in some cases advanced functionality to the Target Documents, enabling them to be fully operationally effective and unambiguous. 

The different Types of Supporting Documents have different functions. Some Supporting Document types are required for all Immutable Documents and Primary Documents; while others are only required for certain Primary Document Types. 

Most Supporting Document types can be freely modified through the governance processes specified elsewhere in the Atlas. The Active Data Supporting Document type can be modified in real time by processes outside of said governance processes. 

Supporting Documents always have Document Identifiers that contain at least one 0.

##### A.1.2.2.1.4 - Accessory Document Category [Core]  <!-- UUID: dfb4784c-2d53-4643-ae0f-debab9dd5aec -->

Accessory Documents provide accessory data to every other Atlas Document type. There are two types of Accessory Documents: Translation Documents and Archive Documents. Translation Documents can be edited directly by Facilitators, while Archive Documents are Immutable. Accessory Documents always have Document Identifiers that contain letters in addition to the standard 'A' prefix of all Atlas Document Identifiers.

##### A.1.2.2.1.0.4.1 - Determine How They Are Modified - Immutable Documents Can Be Amended In The Transition To Endgame [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: c3f58d8c-f734-4b5b-a2c9-261c7eb02d97 -->

Currently, in the transition to Endgame, the Immutable Documents (Articles and Sections) can be amended pursuant to [A.1.10 - Weekly Governance Cycle](83edd4e1-692e-4566-a415-b8f272c33c5e) and [A.1.11 - Monthly Governance Cycle](7f2ba62c-9b3b-4df6-aa16-189a749cffa3)[**.**](7f2ba62c-9b3b-4df6-aa16-189a749cffa3) Once the Sky Ecosystem enters the Endgame State, the Immutable Documents of the Atlas will be forever locked down and cannot be changed.

#### A.1.2.2.2 - List Of Document Types And Their Specifications [Core]  <!-- UUID: 428b7f2e-30b0-4119-a10a-9c3496f19bd2 -->

The subdocuments herein are Type Specification Documents defining the standardized characteristics and requirements that all Atlas Documents must adhere to in order to be considered valid and aligned.

##### A.1.2.2.2.8 - The Original Context Data Type [Type Specification]  <!-- UUID: ff7f74ee-356d-403c-9454-56fcef514e9e -->

[See below]

**Components**:

"Content": The Content Component should contain all relevant information to understand the intention and reasoning behind the wording and elements of the main Document.

**Doc Identifier Rules**:

Original Context Data Documents must always be located at the .0.1 position of their Target Document, or nested in a subtree of Original Context Data Documents below the .0.1 position.

**Additional Logic**:

The Original Context Data Document should be in a finished form alongside the creation or modification of its Target Document, as it aims to capture the original context and intention of the contents of the Target Document. However, it can and should be modified if new evidence and data comes to light that helps to better describe the original context and intention of the Target Document, or if new perspectives or new external events makes it possible and useful to modify the Original Context Data Document in a way that doesn’t contradict its earlier language.

**Type Category**:

Supporting Document

**Type Name**:

Original Context Data

**Type Overview**:

Original Context Data Documents explain the intention and reasoning behind the content of its Target Document, to make interpretation and extrapolation of its contents easier, and provide additional information to other forms of analysis. Original Context Data helps anchor the fundamental purpose and meaning of the target document to its original context, and should help mitigate cultural drift over time. Original Context Data can contain unstructured data used for genesis data integration of early Atlas Documents. Original Context Data Documents can form nested subtrees to organize their data if relevant.

##### A.1.2.2.2.9 - The Element Annotation Directory Type [Type Specification]  <!-- UUID: 95ad533a-40d0-4dbd-8d3a-3224ac77e672 -->

**Type Overview**:

The Element Annotation Directory Type is a directory used to list all of the Element Annotation Documents pertaining to a Target Document.

##### A.1.2.2.2.10 - The Element Annotation Type [Type Specification]  <!-- UUID: 71db0980-a49f-4d48-b277-87f9a2340a8f -->

[See below]

**Components**:

"Element": The Element Component should contain the unique word or phrase from the Target Document that is being annotated.

"Annotation": The Annotation Component should concisely disambiguate and bound the semantic meaning of problematic terms in the Target Document. Such terms can be vague, ambiguous or technical jargon specific to the Target Document.

**Doc Identifier Rules**:

Element Annotation Documents must always be located as subdocuments to the Element Annotation Directory Document of their Target Document. Element Annotation documents are located at the .0.3.X position, with X being the incremented number.

**Additional Logic**:

Element Annotation Documents should be updated as necessary to reflect changes in the understanding or interpretation of the Element and/or any related Atlas document, while maintaining consistency with the Target Document. The Element Annotation should not contradict its Target Document or other context data of the Target Document.

The "Name" property of each Element Annotation Document instance must follow a standardized template: the annotated Element is listed first, followed by a hyphen, and the phrase "Element Annotation".

**Type Category**:

Supporting Document

**Type Name**:

Element Annotation

**Type Overview**:

Element Annotation Documents provide further specification of the semantic meaning of vague or ambiguous terms in the Target Document. Element Annotation Documents can also briefly define technical jargon that is unique to the Target Document. Element Annotation Documents can be thought of as serving a function similar to that of a footnote: they can provide useful context or commentary. Element Annotations should be as concise as possible.

##### A.1.2.2.2.11 - The Facilitator Action Tenet Directory Type [Type Specification]  <!-- UUID: fa44ae5a-01e6-4583-8ff5-a6e1458df62e -->

[See below]

**Components**:

"Directory index": This Component should contain a list of the Facilitator Action Tenets contained within, with keys being the document identifiers and values being their document names.

**Additional Logic**:



**Type Category**:

Supporting Document

**Type Name**:

Facilitator Action Tenet Directory

**Type Overview**:

The Facilitator Action Tenet Directory Type is a directory Type used to list all of the Facilitator Action Tenet Documents that pertain to a Target Document. Facilitator Action Tenet Documents specify adjudication principles and guidelines that are directly derived from the Target Document. When a controversy concerns the Target Document, the Facilitators must consult and apply the pertinent Action Tenet(s) in their decision-making.

##### A.1.2.2.2.12 - The Facilitator Action Tenet Type [Type Specification]  <!-- UUID: 9ab18c94-b9b6-43d0-b260-873ad1ef66fe -->

[See below]

**Components**:

"Content": The Tenet Component specifies the adjudication logic, principle or doctrine that is directly derived from the Target Document. This Component can include policy statements underpinning the adjudication principle. Such policy statements can highlight the values that are served by, or the benefits gained from, adhering to the Tenet. When facing edge cases, these policy statements can help Facilitators to extrapolate from the Tenet's logic to achieve the most suitable outcome.

**Doc Identifier Rules**:

Facilitator Action Tenet Documents must always be located as subdocuments of the Facilitator Action Tenet Directory Document (which latter is located at position .0.4) of their Target Document. Action Tenet documents are located at the .0.4.X position, with X being the incremented number.

**Additional Logic**:

Facilitator Action Tenet Documents are likely to be necessary supplements for interpreting the Immutable Document types, as these tend to have generalized, broad language. The Core Document type has the function of operationalizing the Immutable Documents, and thus its language will tend to be far more specific and concrete. For that reason, Action Tenet Supporting Documents may not be necessary for a particular Core Document. This is not a hard-coded rule, however. The determination of whether an Action Tenet Document is needed for any given Atlas document should always be tailor-made.

Action Tenet Documents should be created and updated as necessary to reflect changes in governance practices, provide clarity on decision-making processes, and enhance understanding of governance principles and rules. The examples should not contradict their Target Document or other Supporting Documents of the Target Document.

If the Action Tenet can be anchored to a specific term from the Target Document, that term is listed first; followed by a hyphen; and then, an abstract of the Action Tenet logic, e.g.: "Organizational Drift - ACs' Mandate When Instigating Action Can Be Traced Back to a Discrete Entity". If the Action Tenet cannot be anchored to a specific term from the Target Document, the "Name" property should simply summarize the Action Tenet logic, e.g.: "Evaluating AC breach of role-specific requirement vs. general requirement".

**Type Category**:

Supporting Document

**Type Name**:

Facilitator Action Tenet

**Type Overview**:

The Facilitator Action Tenet Type is used to provide concrete adjudication principles derived from its Target Document. It distills the governance logic of the Target Document into a concise principle to guide Facilitators in resolving disputes related to the Target Document. The practical application of the Tenet is demonstrated by its "Scenario" Subdocuments.

##### A.1.2.2.2.13 - The Facilitator Action Precedent Directory Type [Type Specification]  <!-- UUID: fd4260fd-f56d-40e7-bd8a-baefa1901dff -->

[See below]

**Components**:

"Directory index": This Component should contain a list of the Facilitator Action Precedents contained within, with keys being the document identifiers and values being their document names.

**Doc Identifier Rules**:

Facilitator Action Precedent Directory Documents must always be located at the .0.5 position below their Target Document.

**Additional Logic**:

A Facilitator Action Precedent Directory Document must be updated whenever a new Facilitator Action Precedent Document is added that meaningfully changes what should be contained in the Directory overview Component.

**Type Category**:

Supporting Document

**Type Name**:

Facilitator Action Precedent Directory

**Type Overview**:

Facilitator Action Precedent Directory Documents list all of the Facilitator Action Precedent Documents that pertain to a Target Document. Facilitator Action Precedent Documents record data about Facilitator Actions, including ongoing actions, that are primarily based on interpretation of content of the Target Document.

##### A.1.2.2.2.14 - The Facilitator Action Precedent Type [Type Specification]  <!-- UUID: 7323b3c5-ffd3-4f8f-af51-5d176531dd0f -->

[See below]

**Components**:

"Input": The Input Component must contain a description of the situation or context in which the Facilitator Action takes place. This could include any relevant information, such as the state of governance or the specific issue at hand.

"Output": The Output Component must contain a description of the Facilitator's action and the outcome or decision that resulted from it. This should provide a clear illustration of how the Facilitator responded to the situation.

"Label": The Label Component indicates whether the Facilitator's action is considered aligned or misaligned according to the principles and rules of governance. This judgment is intended to guide future actions and decisions. If the label is misaligned, it must also specify the penalty that is applied to the Facilitator for misalignment. The Label must always be marked as Aligned when it is created by the Facilitator, and further action by Sky Governance can directly modify this later according to the specifications of the Atlas Documents relevant to appealing Facilitator Actions.

**Doc Identifier Rules**:

Facilitator Action Precedent Documents must always be located as subdocuments of the Facilitator Action Precedent Directory Document of their Target Document.

**Additional Logic**:

Facilitator Action Precedent Documents should be created and updated as necessary to reflect changes in governance practices, provide clarity on decision-making processes, and enhance understanding of governance principles and rules. The Precedents should not contradict their Target Document or other Supporting Documents of the Target Document.

**Type Category**:

Supporting Document

**Type Name**:

**Type Category**:

Primary Document

**Type Name**:

Budget Controller

**Type Overview**:

The Budget Controller Type is used to manage the budgets used by Sky to operationalize the Scopes to achieve the purpose and goals of the Spirit of the Atlas. It controls variable state that specifically authorizes executive votes to disburse payments from the Sky Surplus Buffer, or authorize smart contracts to disburse such payments. The Budget Controller Document determines the rules and processes for modifying and using the budgets contained in the Budget Documents that are attached to it. Budget Controllers also have Active Data Documents attached that are used to report on the status and results of projects funded through the Budget Documents.

##### A.1.2.2.2.19 - The Budget Directory Type [Type Specification]  <!-- UUID: 0d1f3e25-089f-41ab-994a-39225b164e69 -->

"Definition": The Definition Component contains the detailed definition of the term.

**Doc Identifier Rules**:

Definition Documents must always be located as subdocuments of the Definition Directory Document of their Target Document.

**Additional Logic**:

To the extent possible it should be avoided to have the same term defined multiple times in the Atlas, and instead always put a single definition at a location in the Atlas that covers all of its use. The main exception to this principle should be when relatively niche terms are present in two different Scopes.

**Type Category**:

Supporting Document

**Type Name**:

Definition

**Type Overview**:

The Definition Type is used for documents that define unique concepts contained in subdocuments to the Target Document of the Definition Document

##### A.1.2.2.2.23 - The Translation Type [Type Specification]  <!-- UUID: dde9bb23-9ba2-4de6-a3fe-3093e5108fa4 -->

"Name": This Component should be an abstract or very brief description of the Scenario, e.g., "Crafter approves pull request authored by Prime Team." A Scenario’s Name should never be followed by a number unless there are multiple Scenarios with the same Name.

"Description": This Component contains the hypothetical fact pattern that illustrates the application of its parent Facilitator Action Tenet. The fact pattern should be as concrete in its details as possible, so as to be helpful to the Facilitators' decision-making.

"Finding": This Component indicates whether, in this Scenario, the Target Document logic was or was not breached. If the Target Document was not breached, the Finding is "Aligned". If the Target Document was breached, the Finding is "Misaligned".

"Additional Guidance": This Component provides additional context on the specific aspects of the Scenario that were salient to the Aligned or Misaligned finding. It can also provide guidance in terms of how the Facilitators should respond to such a Scenario, i.e.: follow-up actions or means of investigation.

**Doc Identifier Rules**:

Facilitator Scenario Documents must always be located as subdocuments of the Facilitator Scenario Directory Document, which in turn is nested under its parent Facilitator Action Tenet Document, e.g.: A.1.1-1.0.4.1.1.1.

A Scenario’s Name should never be followed by a number unless there are multiple Scenarios with the same Name.

**Additional Logic**:



**Type Category**:

Supporting Document

**Type Name**:

Facilitator Scenario

**Type Overview**:

Facilitator Scenario Documents contain hypothetical fact patterns that are designed to illustrate the practical application of a single Facilitator Action Tenet, i.e., its parent Facilitator Action Tenet Document. Scenarios are classified as either Aligned or Misaligned. Aligned Scenarios conform to the logic of the Target Document. Misaligned Scenarios have breached the Target Document logic and are thus in violation of the Atlas.

##### A.1.2.2.2.29 - The Scenario Variation Type [Type Specification]  <!-- UUID: 935bd219-df68-4466-99fe-0f9c5b328032 -->

[See below]

**Components**:

"Description": This Component contains the hypothetical fact pattern that illustrates the application of its parent Facilitator Action Tenet. The fact pattern should be as concrete in its details as possible, so as to be helpful to the Facilitators' decision-making.

"Finding": This Component indicates whether, in this Scenario Variation, the Target Document logic was or was not breached. If the Target Document was not breached, the Finding is "Aligned". If the Target Document was breached, the Finding is "Misaligned".

"Additional Guidance": This Component provides additional context on the specific aspects of the Scenario Variation that were salient to the Aligned or Misaligned finding. It can also provide guidance in terms of how the Facilitators should respond to such a Scenario, i.e.: follow-up actions or means of investigation.

**Doc Identifier Rules**:

Scenario Variation Documents are located as subdocuments to the Scenario Document of which they are a variation. Their Document Identifier is the same as their parent Scenario, with an additional suffix 'var' followed by the variation number of the original Scenario document. For example, the second Scenario Variation of the original Scenario document `A.1.1.0.4.1.1.1.` would have the following identifier: `A.1.1.0.4.1.1.1.var2` .

**Additional Logic**:



**Type Category**:

Supporting Document

**Type Name**:

Facilitator Scenario Variation

**Type Overview**:

Facilitator Scenario Variation Documents are variations on the hypothetical fact patterns presented in their parent Scenario document ("original Scenario"). Each Variation substitutes elements of its original Scenario to demonstrate whether and why the finding of Aligned/Misaligned would change. 

Like the Scenario Type, Scenario Variations are also designed to illustrate the practical application of a single Facilitator Action Tenet, i.e., the Scenario’s parent Facilitator Action Tenet Document. 

Scenario Variations are classified as either Aligned or Misaligned. Aligned Scenarios conform to the logic of the Target Document. Misaligned Scenarios have breached the Target Document logic and are thus in violation of the Atlas.

##### A.1.2.2.2.30 - The Needed Research Type [Type Specification]  <!-- UUID: 90490d29-6410-4d0b-b3f7-7359615fb656 -->

[See below]

**Components**:

"Research Prompt": This component contains descriptions of potential problems, unanswered questions or other concerns associated with the Target Document.

**Doc Identifier Rules**:

Unlike other Supporting Documents, the document identifier of Needed Research documents is not derived from the Supporting Root of their Target Document. The "standalone" numbering scheme of Needed Research documents enables them to be linked to more than one Atlas Document, no matter the latter’s location in the Atlas document tree. Needed Research Document Identifiers begin with the prefix "NR-",  followed by an incremented number.

**Additional Logic**:

Generally, Needed Research Documents are most effective when linked to Primary Documents or Supporting Documents. These Document types have the objective of extrapolating from the abstract logic of their Parent documents to formulate rules and processes that are more concrete and actionable. Therefore, inputs for Needed Research are more appropriately sourced at this deeper level in the Atlas Document tree.

**Type Category**:

Supporting Document

**Type Name**:

Needed Research

**Type Overview**:

Needed Research Documents specify potential problems associated with their Target Document. Such problems can include potential gaps or conflicts in logic; questions regarding the operation of the Target Document to which there are currently no answers; etc.

As such, Needed Research documents formalize continuing research into Universal Alignment and enable the adaptive intelligence of the ecosystem to drive the evolution of Sky. Scope Facilitators, Atlas workstream contributors or other ecosystem participants are able to submit Needed Research inputs, which are then progressively processed through the standardized Atlas data integration protocol.

The gradual processing of Needed Research inputs can lead to modifications to the organization or content of Atlas documents, as well as concrete process improvements and new initiatives.

### A.1.2.3 - Conflict Resolution [Section]  <!-- UUID: e883ceb7-707d-4b1d-af3c-ed6f9aeac565 -->

The Core Facilitator is responsible for evaluating and resolving community appeals regarding Atlas document misalignment.

#### A.1.2.3.1 - Request for Review [Core]  <!-- UUID: 252d3948-9753-4440-b554-350809a047ac -->

Where a potential instance of Atlas document misalignment is perceived, community members may submit a Request for Review to the Core Facilitator. This Request for Review should be posted in the Sky Forum. The Request for Review need not follow any specific template. Pursuant to [A.0.1.2.1 - Facilitators’ Broad Discretionary Capacity](f18229fe-fbc3-4dc8-ad84-4bca2915f6c4), the Core Facilitator have broad discretion in evaluating and resolving such Requests for Review.

## A.1.3 - Governance Accessibility [Article]  <!-- UUID: 08176561-7acf-47e0-bb54-41771d54b15f -->

This Article regulates the design and implementation of platforms for facilitating accessible and transparent governance.

### A.1.3.1 - Atlas Operational Platform [Section]  <!-- UUID: f98a02aa-8b07-45c8-aff2-56dc4359d8e6 -->

This Section must define infrastructure and requirements pertaining to the development and deployment of the Atlas Operational Platform. The Atlas Operational Platform must enable accessible participation in the Governance Scope. It should provide a comprehensive and user-friendly overview of all data and processes relevant to the Governance Scope, ensuring legibility, transparency, and easy verification of processes and decisions.

## A.1.4 - Alignment Conservers [Article]  <!-- UUID: df4f9bfd-e743-44b5-9c62-9c5f10b15340 -->

Alignment Conservers (ACs) safeguard the Sky Governance process, ensuring its alignment with the Spirit of the Atlas. This Article defines requirements and processes related to Alignment Conservers.

### A.1.4.1 - ACs Subject To Strict Requirements [Section]  <!-- UUID: 2f8514da-814a-4fca-884c-741f21329866 -->

Alignment Conservers are subject to strict requirements due to their critical role in safeguarding the resilience and alignment of the Sky Ecosystem.

#### A.1.4.1.1 - Role Of Core Facilitator [Core]  <!-- UUID: c1fded55-6819-49c0-b008-008e1914362a -->

The Core Facilitator must be vigilant in enforcing all rules applicable to Alignment Conservers. The Core Facilitator must take prompt action against Alignment Conservers if they break rules specified in the Atlas, or otherwise act misaligned.

### A.1.4.2 - ACs Must Safeguard The Spirit Of The Atlas [Section]  <!-- UUID: 933c2078-5353-4788-85cf-65bb0975f916 -->

Alignment Conservers must always act to preserve the Spirit of the Atlas and to protect Sky Ecosystem against all forms of corruption, organizational drift, and other misalignment threats.

### A.1.4.3 - Universal Alignment Requirements [Section]  <!-- UUID: 403a05ce-f8e0-4ecf-8a56-026c0acd0d8a -->

Alignment Conservers must operate only within the clearly delineated processes and frameworks of the Immutable Documents. ACs are strictly prohibited from colluding or secretly organizing to circumvent or undermine the Spirit of the Atlas. Any action of an Alignment Conserver that disrupts the governance dynamic of Sky is considered misalignment, as is any inaction that allows such violations to occur.

#### A.1.4.3.0.3.1 - Circumvent - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 847eceb7-d788-437b-a8a3-b38d06e873ba -->

The element "circumvent" means to find a way to evade or distort the Atlas’ established rules, principles, or processes, with the intent to undermine Universal Alignment.

#### A.1.4.3.0.3.2 - Clearly Delineated Processes and Frameworks - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: a9ad7689-50d0-465c-9983-75b0fb065082 -->

The element, "clearly delineated processes and frameworks," highlights a central issue in interpreting the Atlas. All language must be interpreted to be understood. In this sense, eliminating subjectivity is an unattainable goal. (Even an artificial intelligence system which eliminates many steps of research for the user will still serve up information that must be first interpreted by the user before it can be effective.) Inference or extrapolation is necessarily inherent in interpretation, and comes in degrees. In the context of the Target Document, the element, "clearly delineated processes and frameworks," affirms that an interpreter's extraction of rules/principles/processes should be maximally grounded in the explicit language of the Immutable Documents.

#### A.1.4.3.0.3.3 - Colluding - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 5ecf688c-6f6f-4923-844b-a605966a31d1 -->

The element "colluding" refers to the act of conspiring or working together in secret to achieve an outcome that violates or undermines Universal Alignment or the Spirit of the Atlas.

#### A.1.4.3.0.3.4 - Governance Dynamic - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: ac81d874-6f5a-45db-8d92-390b220d59d8 -->

The element "governance dynamic" refers generally to the balance of power and the integrity of operational processes that sustain Sky’s Governance system. Disruption of this dynamic can lead to instability or misalignment.

#### A.1.4.3.0.3.5 - Inaction - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 666f3928-99f8-410e-a928-ad060d5cc354 -->

The element "inaction" refers to the failure to act when action is necessary to prevent or address breaches of Universal Alignment or the Spirit of the Atlas. Inaction is considered as serious as active misalignment.

#### A.1.4.3.0.3.6 - Secretly Organizing - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 21ec2c20-28fe-43e9-9e30-9e548bda7531 -->

The element "secretly organizing" is closely related to the term "colluding". See [A.1.4.3.0.3.3 - Colluding - Element Annotation](5ecf688c-6f6f-4923-844b-a605966a31d1). "Secretly organizing" means planning or coordinating actions behind closed doors, with the malign intent to bypass or undermine official processes or principles.

#### A.1.4.3.0.4.1 - Clearly Delineated Processes and Frameworks - AC actions must be grounded in explicit frameworks of Immutable Documents [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 61420b37-9c0f-424d-bb5e-dd5f261d3547 -->

Generally, when an AC acts to impact governance in any way, they must do so according to rules/principles/processes that are based on the explicit language of the Immutable Documents. Because of the nature of language and the fact that the Atlas can never anticipate all possible scenarios, it will sometimes be necessary for the basis of ACs' actions to be sourced from extrapolations or inferences of logic, but these must be grounded.

'Grounded inferences' means that derivations, deductions or extensions of governance logic maintain a strong, clear connection and alignment with the delineated processes and frameworks explicitly defined in the Immutable Documents.

Because ungrounded inferences of logic lack such a robust and clearly documented foundation, they introduce severe misalignment risk given the potential for intentional misrepresentation or distortion. The interpreter may deviate from the genuine intent of the Immutable Documents, not driven by an earnest effort to understand but rather influenced by personal motives or ulterior agendas.

### A.1.4.4 - Standard of Proof In Universal Alignment Controversies [Section]  <!-- UUID: 034a9ad7-5d4d-40db-bef8-cad80c0a01e2 -->

Alignment Conservers are held to the highest standard when judging whether their actions are Universally Aligned.

#### NR-1 - Systematic Basis Of Adjudication, Fact-Finding And Evidence [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: 2da58ba2-a172-43bd-b7e7-d3d8e69233bf -->

**Content**:

The Atlas has made a good start with establishing an adjudication framework. There is some logic concerning procedures for how disputes and controversies (including Alignment Conserver misalignment) are brought forward and how they are reviewed. But essential elements are missing, such as protocols and standards for fact-finding and evidence.

Needed Research here includes methods for implementing a structured fact-finding process that gathers relevant information impartially and comprehensively. Who has the authority to investigate, to request evidence, to handle evidence? What types of evidence are permissible to consider, and what ethical considerations apply to how such evidence was obtained? What are the processes for collecting, preserving, and analyzing this evidence? When should evidence be shared with the larger community and when should it be kept confidential?

Then there is the matter of assessing evidence in a way that is rigorous and impartial, without which, confidence in the Atlas and the governance process may be undermined. What criteria should be used to validate and evaluate evidence to ensure its reliability and relevance in decision-making? This involves determining the credibility of sources, the reliability of evidence, and the relevance of information to the specific case. The research should explore different approaches to evidence evaluation, such as the application of the burden of proof, standards of proof (e.g., preponderance of evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt), and the use of experts.

How much discretion should Facilitators have in interpreting and applying the element "the highest standard of Universal Alignment"? How to safeguard against bias and ensure all Facilitator adjudications are made impartially? Investigate mechanisms to maintain objectivity and impartiality throughout the adjudication, fact-finding, and evidence evaluation processes. This could include the establishment of independent review panels (which could operate post facto to avoid excessively delaying the deplatforming of misaligned ACs), the use of conflict-of-interest policies, and training on cognitive biases for those involved in decision-making.

This need is an extensive Research Track. The central research need that grows out of the Facilitator role has to do with developing systematic principles and protocols to serve as the foundation for adjudicating disputes and controversies, including processes for fact-finding, evidence validation and evaluation, mechanisms for ensuring impartiality and objectivity, an appeals process, etc.

#### A.1.4.4.0.4.1 - Highest Standard - Facilitators must apply strictest possible requirements of Universal Alignment on ACs [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 8dfd71fc-7ded-4217-8b6a-2bef00f75b55 -->

In any adjudication involving potential misalignment of Alignment Conservers (ACs), Facilitators are unequivocally directed to apply the strictest and highest standards of Universal Alignment.

As ACs are held to the most rigorous standards of Universal Alignment, Facilitators should acknowledge evidence of misalignment if such evidence is deemed at least 51% more likely than not to be valid or to substantiate the presented claim. Additionally, should the overall weight of the evidence demonstrate a 51% or greater chance that the AC committed a misaligned act, the Facilitator is required to derecognize the AC.

Given the exceptionally high stakes in cases of potential AC misalignment, Facilitators must prioritize an approach grounded in an abundance of caution, steering away from notions of 'fairness' or 'lenience.' Any lapse or misjudgment on the part of an AC cannot be excused based on ignorance of the rules, good intentions, honest mistake or similar factors. Maximal accountability for ACs is non-negotiable, a principle underpinned by the indispensable role of ACs as stewards of Universal Alignment.

### A.1.4.5 - ACs Can Be Operationally Active In Only One Role At A Time [Section]  <!-- UUID: 9b1d1c2f-ace0-4637-8050-4711ae9f9a8c -->

An Alignment Conserver can assume one of two roles: Aligned Delegate (AD) and Facilitator. ACs may only be operationally active in a single AC role and may not simultaneously assume multiple AC roles or other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors.

#### NR-2 - Should Ban Against Occupying Two Ecosystem Roles Apply to All Sky Stakeholder Roles? [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: 25d8f23b-4d43-43be-aa5a-c48fe372cd7a -->

**Content**:

Given the rationale behind the Target Document [A.1.4 - A5 - Alignment Conservers - Powers And Constraints - ACs Can Be Operationally Active In Only One Role At A Time](9b1d1c2f-ace0-4637-8050-4711ae9f9a8c), the 'simultaneous occupying of two ecosystem roles' prohibition should likely not be limited to just the AC stakeholder category, but rather should apply universally to any Sky stakeholder who occupies a role formally defined in the Atlas. What would be the arguments for and against such a position?

#### NR-3 - Should Team Contributors Be Subject To The Ban Against Occupying Two Ecosystem Roles? [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: 4560326b-abab-4147-957f-c5c8ddfa96f1 -->

**Content**:

Should team contributors be subject to the Target Document’s prohibition against occupying two roles? What would be the arguments for and against such a position? 

One argument against this would be that quality contributors are a scarce resource. Further, the decentralized work paradigm encourages having several part-time jobs. 

The sharing of contributors across several Sky teams  - such that contributors gain experience in multiple operational aspects - might arguably enhance ecosystem intelligence. 

Would it make a meaningful difference to require contributors who do wish to work multiple roles to be doxxed?

#### A.1.4.5.1 - Temporary Exception for Facilitator “Ecosystem” [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6aa88317-4dc2-4b50-87bd-27cc6de9c767 -->

The Facilitator "Ecosystem" is temporarily exempt from the general rule prohibiting Alignment Conservers from being operationally active in multiple ecosystem roles. "Ecosystem" will continue to act in the Facilitator role as well as provide operational services as an Ecosystem Actor. This exception must be resolved as soon as it is reasonably possible to do so.

#### A.1.4.5.0.3.1 - Operationally Active - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 8d706ce8-3d1f-4791-b416-a3a037b93feb -->

The element "operationally active" refers to being formally engaged in a specific role that is defined in the Atlas as executing a mission or function within the Sky ecosystem.

#### A.1.4.5.0.4.1 - Operationally Active - Whether An Entity Is “Operationally Active" In A Role Is Determined Purely On A Formal Basis [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 38c70e00-b5b8-4d1b-9f57-809ef284cb25 -->

Whether an entity is "operationally active" in a role is determined purely on a formal basis. As long as an entity occupies or assumes a role that is formally defined in the Atlas, that entity is "operationally active" in that role. This is notwithstanding the amount of time the entity devotes to a role; the nature of the work performed by the entity in a role; the fact that the entity is on a leave of absence from one role; the fact that the entity's role is uncompensated; or the fact that the entity alternates between two roles to avoid simultaneous performance of both roles.

This Tenet is based on the rationale of protecting against misalignment risks that arise when a stakeholder occupies two or more ecosystem roles, each of which has different mandates and inner incentives. Such misalignment risks include conflict of interest and bias, collusion and conspiracy.

See also, [A.1.4.5.0.4.2 - Other Ecosystem Roles  - Phrase Must Be Read In Its Broadest Sense By Facilitators](56fd4055-b412-4058-a33a-57d4d1b54181).

##### A.1.4.5.0.4.1.1.1 - Alternating Between Two Roles In Separate Time Intervals [Scenario]  <!-- UUID: d5e82bc9-9d46-4d1b-a580-dc695d4a3c19 -->

**Description**:

Entity occupied the role of a ranked Aligned Delegate. Entity then applied for, and secured, the role of a Facilitator. The entity actively occupied these two roles, but alternated between them in separate time intervals.

**Finding**:

Misaligned

**Additional Guidance**:

That Entity is alternating between two roles to perform their duties in separate time intervals does not negate the misalignment risk that the Target Document is intended to protect against. They are still formally occupying two roles at once. They still have access to sensitive information and experiences in two roles with different mandates and incentives.

The Facilitator should derecognize Entity per [A.1.4 - A10 - Alignment Conservers - Accountability And Misalignment Handling - AC Derecognition](ac998664-5b5e-4ea5-813b-dc3105ea6cf2).

###### A.1.4.5.0.4.1.1.1.var1 - Alternating Between Two Roles In Separate Time Intervals - var. 1 [Scenario Variation]  <!-- UUID: b7eb5043-6f80-4dcf-8392-fbb3e200cf9e -->

**Description**:

Entity occupied the role of an unranked Aligned Delegate. Entity then applied for, and secured, the role of a Facilitator. Entity actively occupied these two roles, but alternated between them in separate time intervals.

**Finding**:

Misaligned

**Additional Guidance**:

An "ecosystem role" need not be compensated or full-time to be regulated by the Target Document. See [Other Ecosystem Roles - Ecosystem Role Need Not Be Compensated Or Full-Time To Be Regulated Under Target Document](9b3828a7-0e71-4c63-82d2-8f65ee84a1ca).

An unranked, uncompensated Aligned Delegate is nevertheless an 'ecosystem role' in the sense of the Target Document. Notwithstanding being unranked and uncompensated, the AD role still carries with it a mandate and array of incentives that are distinct from those of a Facilitator.

The Facilitator should derecognize Entity from both AC roles per [A.1.4 - A10 - Alignment Conservers - Accountability And Misalignment Handling - AC Derecognition](ac998664-5b5e-4ea5-813b-dc3105ea6cf2).

##### A.1.4.5.0.4.1.1.2 - On-Call Or Stand-By Role [Scenario]  <!-- UUID: 01e5369d-c05c-41ae-99d4-d489aa84eaee -->

**Description**:

Entity was an Aligned Delegate. Entity then secured a second role with an Ecosystem Actor providing Executive spell crafting services, specifically as an "on call" dev. Entity claims it has never been on active duty in the second role; rather, they have only ever been on "standby" in that role. Thus, Entity argued it did not violate the Target Document despite holding two ecosystem roles.

**Finding**:

Misaligned

**Additional Guidance**:

If an actor assumes more than one role in the Sky ecosystem, the risks of conflict of interest, collusion, conspiracy and other misaligned behavior necessarily arises. That the Entity's second position is in an "on-call" or stand-by position does not negate this risk. Entity is still formally occupying two roles with different mandates, incentives and access/permissions. It is conceivable that Entity's decision-making in their first role could be compromised or influenced, even in subtle ways, by the experiences, knowledge and biases to which Entity is exposed in their second role. Therefore, the risk of misalignment, which the Target Document aims to guard against, remains present.

The Facilitator should derecognize Entity as an AD per [A.1.4 - A10 - Alignment Conservers - Accountability And Misalignment Handling - AC Derecognition](ac998664-5b5e-4ea5-813b-dc3105ea6cf2).

No specific logic exists as yet for the adjudication of misalignment on the part of an Ecosystem Actor team member.

###### A.1.4.5.0.4.1.1.2.var1 - On-Call Or Standby Role - var. 1 [Scenario Variation]  <!-- UUID: 1b2b438f-e34c-4683-97ef-2227f6c425eb -->

**Description**:

Entity was an Aligned Delegate. Entity then secured a second role with an Ecosystem Actor providing Executive spell crafting services, specifically as an "on call" dev. Entity claims it has never been on active duty in the second role; rather, they have only ever been on "standby" in that role. Thus, Entity argued it did not violate the Target Document despite holding two ecosystem roles. During its investigation, the Facilitator discovered evidence that, despite the EA having a general policy that "on call" devs are paid only a nominal fee for the bounded time periods they are on call, Entity had been receiving an inordinately large compensation from the EA. When the Facilitator pressed both the EA and Entity for an explanation, none was given.

**Finding**:

Misaligned as to Entity.

**Additional Guidance**:

In contrast to the original Scenario, the Facilitator uncovered evidence that indicates Entity was not, as claimed, a mere "on call" dev, but rather was engaged in substantive work to justify the large compensation amount. 

That the Facilitator was stonewalled in its investigation also is a strong indication of malign intent on the part of Entity and the EA. Yet, there is no concrete proof of this. 

Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to extrapolate that derecognition from the AC role would suffice, per [A.1.4 - A10 - Alignment Conservers - Accountability And Misalignment Handling - AC Derecognition](ac998664-5b5e-4ea5-813b-dc3105ea6cf2).

The concern remains that, potentially, a bad actor can continue to exploit the ecosystem, especially if other ecosystem participants are not aware of their questionable history. To mitigate this risk, the Facilitator can include details about the evidence it discovered in its formal derecognition notice, which can impact the reputation score of Entity.

##### A.1.4.5.0.4.1.1.3 - Resignation Notice Not Received [Scenario]  <!-- UUID: 5754dde6-7b8f-45d6-a633-c40fd6382ca6 -->

**Description**:

Entity was a full-time team member of a Core Facilitator. Entity emailed the Facilitator a formal letter of resignation and then transitioned into the role of an AD. The Facilitator did not receive the resignation email and continued to list Entity as an active team member on the Facilitator team. During the Core Facilitator’s investigation, Entity provided proof of the resignation email. The email clearly stated an effective date of resignation, which date was prior to Entity's transition into the AD role. Entity also provided proof that all their permissions to the Facilitator team workspace were revoked; and they had no further communications or interactions with the Facilitator team after their intended resignation date.

**Finding**:

Aligned

**Additional Guidance**:

Though the Facilitator incorrectly continued to list Entity as a team member, in actual practice, Entity had cut all ties with the Facilitator team after the intended resignation date. This was proven via the dated resignation email; the revoked permissions; and the lack of communications. Given these facts, the Target Document is not triggered.

###### A.1.4.5.0.4.1.1.3.var1 - Resignation Notice Not Received - var. 1 [Scenario Variation]  <!-- UUID: b13b099c-c90c-4e1a-9caa-3103c9b333a0 -->

**Description**:

Entity was a part-time team member of a Core Facilitator. Entity then transitioned into the role of an AD. The Facilitator did not receive any resignation notice from Entity and continued to list Entity as an active team member on the Facilitator team. During the Core Facilitator's investigation, Entity claimed it had sent the Facilitator a resignation email, but could not provide actual proof of this. The Core Facilitator also discovered that Entity still had permissions to the Facilitator team workspace. The team's Discord contained casual, non-work related interactions between Entity and the Facilitator team members even after the date Entity became a formally recognized AD.

**Finding**:

Misaligned

**Additional Guidance**:

Entity was unable to provide any proof that it had formally resigned its first role with the Facilitator team. Merely claiming that a resignation email was sent is not sufficient. Further, unlike the original Scenario, Entity in this Variation continued to have access to the Facilitator team workspace even after the alleged date of resignation. Technically speaking, Entity is still formally occupying two roles with different mandates and incentives. The potential exists for conflict of interest, collusion, etc. The part-time role does not impact this analysis.

The Core Facilitator should derecognize Entity from its AD role per [A.1.4 - A10 - Alignment Conservers - Accountability And Misalignment Handling - AC Derecognition](ac998664-5b5e-4ea5-813b-dc3105ea6cf2).

##### A.1.4.5.0.4.1.1.4 - Volunteer Discord Moderator [Scenario]  <!-- UUID: 6ebff450-1cdd-4d57-93c9-0537066daf44 -->

**Description**:

Entity was a volunteer moderator for Sky’s Discord. Without leaving their moderator role, Entity registered and became active as an Aligned Delegate.

**Finding**:

Aligned

**Additional Guidance**:

‘Volunteer Discord moderator' is not a role that is formally defined in the Atlas. Therefore, Entity's first position as volunteer Discord moderator does not count as an ecosystem role. The Target Document is not triggered at all in this Scenario.

#### A.1.4.5.0.4.2 - Other Ecosystem Roles  - Phrase Must Be Read In Its Broadest Sense By Facilitators [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 56fd4055-b412-4058-a33a-57d4d1b54181 -->

The Target Document is violated if an Alignment Conserver formally occupies two or more Sky ecosystem roles. The phrase "other ecosystem roles" is read in its broadest sense to mean the totality of roles that are formally defined in the Atlas with a function in the Sky ecosystem. 

Such "ecosystem roles" include, but are not limited to, Alignment Conserver, Governance Process Support Ecosystem Actor, Active or Incubating Ecosystem Actor, Agent Advisor, Arranger, and the contributors supporting these aforementioned actors. 

The rationale of this rule is to protect against misalignment risks that arise when a stakeholder occupies two or more ecosystem roles, each of which has different mandates and inner incentives. Such misalignment risks include conflict of interest and bias, collusion and conspiracy.

See also, [A.1.4.5.0.4.1 - Operationally Active - Whether An Entity Is "Operationally Active" In A Role Is Determined Purely On A Formal Basis](38c70e00-b5b8-4d1b-9f57-809ef284cb25).

#### A.1.4.5.0.4.3 - Other Ecosystem Roles - Ecosystem Role Need Not Be Compensated Or Full-Time To Be Regulated Under Target Document [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 9b3828a7-0e71-4c63-82d2-8f65ee84a1ca -->

An "ecosystem role" need not be compensated or full-time to be regulated by the Target Document.

### A.1.4.6 - ACs Subject To Both General And Role-specific Requirements [Section]  <!-- UUID: a59420ba-5e2c-4736-99a4-fb64eea4cc32 -->

An Alignment Conserver is fully responsible for meeting all requirements tied to the general AC role, which requirements are specified in this Article. 

In addition, Aligned Delegates and Facilitators must adhere to the specific requirements tied to their specialized roles. These specific requirements are detailed in [A.1.5 - Aligned Delegates](75f0063c-ad70-49e4-b356-9b76097ced7b) and [A.1.6 - Facilitators](1ce24b08-84ff-4524-9710-49bba429c6ef). Breaching these role-specific requirements and responsibilities is misalignment equivalent to breaching the general AC-requirements.

#### A.1.4.6.0.4.1 - Evaluating AC breach of role-specific requirement vs. general requirement [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: eef4ed65-7a72-474a-9f87-d2740bfe1960 -->

When an Alignment Conserver breaches a role-specific requirement, this is misalignment on par with a breach of a general AC requirement, and vice versa. Facilitators must not default to assigning greater or lesser culpability on the sole basis of whether the breached rule is role-specific or general. Apart from this caveat, misaligned acts can have varying degrees of severity or harm, and should be individually evaluated by the Facilitator in any action.

### A.1.4.7 - AC Requirements Of Anonymity And High Operational Security [Section]  <!-- UUID: 36b68ff0-30a3-4fb9-af04-a2869a4233fe -->

The Alignment Conserver roles of Facilitator and Aligned Delegate require anonymity and high levels of operational security. Breaches of these anonymity and operational security requirements are considered serious misalignment. In the event of such breaches, the known identities of individuals holding these AC roles shall be promptly derecognized, and they will be barred from further participation as Alignment Conservers.

#### NR-4 - Operational Security Protocols - Research Track [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: e33879c1-93d0-48a6-8f08-ad00a4821bde -->

**Content**:

The Core Facilitator may not have the needed experience and skills to adjudicate matters involving operational security best practices. See Endgame Edge Governance Facilitator team Forum post ([https://forum.sky.money/t/ads-derecognition-due-to-operational-security-breach/22532#proposal-for-community-discussion-2](https://forum.sky.money/t/ads-derecognition-due-to-operational-security-breach/22532#proposal-for-community-discussion-2)) on AD derecognition:

"The DAO could hire a security advisor firm/consultant as a Scope Advisor. (This could fall under the Governance Scope and its requirement for Governance Security processes). Their task would be to thoroughly analyze the security needs and risks of the Alignment Conservers and develop ever-evolving Operational Security "Best Practices".

With an explicit framework of agreed-upon Best Practices, all anon Alignment Conservers have a known target to meet. Further, the existence of an objective framework of Best Practices equips the Core Facilitator to easily determine when a breach of opsec best practice has occurred. The explicit framework removes the risk of the Facilitator inappropriately inserting subjective bias into the decision-making process.

The Security Scope Advisor could also assist in reviewing an informant's evidence to evaluate its validity/quality. The Security Scope Advisor could ensure that the methods used by the informant to secure the evidence were ethical. (All communications, evidence and data shared with the Security Scope Advisor would be under confidentiality protection). Finally, such an Advisor would have specialized expertise in opsec and associated matters that the Core Facilitator lacks."

This Needed Research is an extensive Research Track, given the wide-ranging implications and potential mechanisms around opsec best practices, and also how these should map onto the Atlas.

#### A.1.4.7.1 - Exemption From Facilitator Anonymity Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: cb2ae821-e9b8-47b0-bda8-bc8bb149c5b5 -->

The Facilitator "Ecosystem" is exempt from the anonymity requirement, as well as the requirement of high levels of operational security insofar as the latter requirement relates to maintaining anonymity. This exemption applies solely to the Facilitator "Ecosystem", as they onboarded into the role prior to the ratification of Atlas v1 (March 27, 2023), which introduced the anonymity requirement for Facilitators.

This exemption applies to limit the effect of the following provisions: [A.1.6.3 - Facilitators Must Maintain High Level Of Operational Security](014feb92-49dc-4117-911f-a6ec14451b30); [A.1.6.4 - Derecognition Required Where Facilitator Operational Security Is Compromised](c3ba34f0-b3f0-449b-b609-52548db090ea); [A.1.6.5 - Facilitators Must Err On Side Of Caution](ac9df70a-d110-42da-805a-abe03b52dcdc); and [A.0.1.1.19 - Facilitator](912e0161-3448-470f-9cf6-d1a26d76acab). 

This limited exemption takes precedence over any conflicting provisions in the Atlas.

#### A.1.4.7.0.4.1 - ADs & Facilitators required to adhere to comprehensive operational security practices [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 598ff9cf-146e-4499-93d3-583518c390a1 -->

The operational security of the Alignment Conserver roles is key to governance integrity overall. Aligned Delegates and Facilitators are mandated to maintain rigorous operational security practices to ensure that their identities and work activities are anonymized and all related information is safeguarded. Such practices must go beyond basic privacy-enhancing measures and must include the use of secure communication channels, stringent data encryption, anonymity tools like VPNs and TOR networks, regular security audits, and rigorous digital footprint management.

### A.1.4.8 - Swift Action Is Required From Facilitators To Redress AC Misalignment [Section]  <!-- UUID: 40f850ee-b3f2-4126-9128-4f6a6b38d275 -->

The Core Facilitator must act swiftly when an AC is suspected of breaching the requirements defined in this Article, or the requirements defined in the Articles specific to the Aligned Delegate or Facilitator role.

The Core Facilitator's failure to act promptly in addressing credible evidence of AC misalignment or to mitigate the risk of misalignment spreading among ACs is considered an act of misalignment itself. Formal allegations of such failure must be adjudicated by Core GovOps pursuant to [A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process](560e1024-0897-4f1e-ae71-3ba31e29ed57).

#### NR-5 - Derecognition Procedure [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: 7b90bfa2-c857-4170-b6cd-2d4adb290aa0 -->

**Content**:

Research specific procedural steps for the derecognition of an AC. The procedure should account for ways in which this process can be streamlined or standardized to ensure swift action. Research should identify potential bottlenecks and suggest ways to eliminate them, such as pre-defined decision-making protocols, clear documentation requirements, and fast-track procedures for urgent cases.

Another point to research involves the concepts of due process or fairness. Specific logic currently active in the Atlas clearly indicates that ACs are held to the highest standards of Universal Alignment. Such a standard would seem to indicate that "fairness" is not an objective in any proceeding involving AC derecognition. What are the arguments for and against this?

#### A.1.4.8.0.3.1 - Risk Of Misalignment Spreading Among ACs - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 13c4f127-0ef2-43b5-a5ac-905719091bdd -->

The element "risk of misalignment spreading among ACs" refers to the potential for misalignment by one AC to influence or lead to misalignment among other ACs, creating a broader systemic risk. The element emphasizes the need for quick action to contain any breach before it spreads and causes wider disruptions.

#### A.1.4.8.0.4.1 - Facilitators’ Authority To Raise Formal Allegation [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: e4e7dab8-5e4d-41ad-b1e0-ba3cb9a6f02a -->

Any community member or Aligned Delegate with information pertinent to suspected Alignment Conserver misalignment may take their concerns directly to the Core Facilitator.  Upon receiving such information, the Core Facilitator must promptly conduct an initial review to quickly assess the credibility of the concern. Based on this preliminary review, the Core Facilitator must decide whether to initiate a formal adjudication process in accordance with [A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process](560e1024-0897-4f1e-ae71-3ba31e29ed57).

Where the allegation of misalignment concerns the Core Facilitator, a community member can take their concerns to Core GovOps, who is then empowered to initiate the formal adjudication process.

#### A.1.4.8.0.4.2 - Must Act Swiftly - Facilitators Must Take Immediate And Prompt Action [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 364aaf22-d12f-4f48-9167-f91d6003dc5b -->

By "swiftly," the Target Document requires Facilitators to take immediate and prompt action without unnecessary delay. The urgency is intended to prevent further harm or disruption within the governance system. A highly time-sensitive response is mandated for any breaches or potential risks of AC misalignment.

### A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process [Section]  <!-- UUID: 560e1024-0897-4f1e-ae71-3ba31e29ed57 -->

The Core Facilitator is responsible for adjudicating formal allegations of misalignment or operational security breaches brought against Alignment Conservers (ACs).

In the adjudication of these matters, the Core Facilitator is mandated to hold ACs to the highest standard of Universal Alignment, without granting them the benefit of the doubt.

The adjudication process is further defined in the subdocuments herein.

#### NR-8 - Systematic Basis Of Adjudication, Fact-Finding And Evidence [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: 279f417e-2fec-473d-ab7c-eaf5b371c598 -->

**Content**:

The Atlas has made a good start with establishing an adjudication framework. There is some logic concerning procedures for how disputes and controversies (including Alignment Conserver misalignment) are brought forward and how they are reviewed. But essential elements are missing, such as protocols and standards for fact-finding and evidence.

Needed Research here includes methods for implementing a structured fact-finding process that gathers relevant information impartially and comprehensively. Who has the authority to investigate, to request evidence, to handle evidence? What types of evidence are permissible to consider, and what ethical considerations apply to how such evidence was obtained? What are the processes for collecting, preserving, and analyzing this evidence? When should evidence be shared with the larger community and when should it be kept confidential?

Then there is the matter of assessing evidence in a way that is rigorous and impartial, without which, confidence in the Atlas and the governance process may be undermined. What criteria should be used to validate and evaluate evidence to ensure its reliability and relevance in decision-making? This involves determining the credibility of sources, the reliability of evidence, and the relevance of information to the specific case. The research should explore different approaches to evidence evaluation, such as the application of the burden of proof, standards of proof (e.g., preponderance of evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt), and the use of experts.

How much discretion should Facilitators have in interpreting and applying the element “the highest standard of Universal Alignment”? How to safeguard against bias and ensure all Facilitator adjudications are made impartially? Investigate mechanisms to maintain objectivity and impartiality throughout the adjudication, fact-finding, and evidence evaluation processes. This could include the establishment of independent review panels (which could operate post facto to avoid excessively delaying the deplatforming of misaligned ACs), the use of conflict-of-interest policies, and training on cognitive biases for those involved in decision-making.

This need is an extensive Research Track. The central research need that grows out of the Facilitator role has to do with developing systematic principles and protocols to serve as the foundation for adjudicating disputes and controversies, including processes for fact-finding, evidence validation and evaluation, mechanisms for ensuring impartiality and objectivity, an appeals process, etc.

#### A.1.4.9.1 - Opportunity to Respond [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4217002f-6c87-45fb-80ac-598472e3fff9 -->

As part of the formal adjudication of AC misalignment or operational security breach, the Core Facilitator must provide the individual/entity subject to the allegation with an opportunity to respond.

##### A.1.4.9.1.0.4.1 - Opportunity To Respond [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: ef3b30b9-a03f-4150-a279-5982b63af973 -->

The opportunity to respond should include sufficient time to prepare a response, the ability to submit information or evidence, and reasonable access to any information pertinent to the allegation. Where an internal or external whistleblower has provided evidence of potential AC misalignment, the Core Facilitator should keep the whistleblower’s identity confidential.

#### A.1.4.9.2 - Imposing Appropriate Penalty [Core]  <!-- UUID: fad2c7d1-4fe0-44e5-a1f7-c551882d78da -->

If the Core Facilitator concludes that the allegation of misalignment or operational security breach was justified, they can impose an appropriate penalty up to and including derecognition of the Alignment Conserver.

##### A.1.4.9.2.1 - Warnings Appropriate For Mild Breach [Core]  <!-- UUID: f8107b34-93b1-4ab8-a6ab-c4e70a048933 -->

In cases of very mild "slippery slope" breaches of the Alignment Conserver requirements, a formal warning may be given and recorded in the subdocuments herein. Where such a breach was the first instance of misalignment by the Alignment Conserver, no disciplinary measures beyond a formal warning are required.

###### NR-6 - Defining Threshold For “Very Mild Slippery Slope" Breaches [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: db47c59f-a822-4213-9305-8c8eb07c41f0 -->

**Content**:

What specific actions or omissions qualify as "very mild slippery slope" breaches? Helpful research can include: developing a set of criteria or a checklist that defines what constitutes a "very mild slippery slope" breach. This could involve an analysis of past or hypothetical incidents, consultations with the Facilitators, etc. Such guidelines are likely needed to help Facilitators reliably determine whether an act should be classified as a 'minor' slippery slope infraction or a more severe act which would merit derecognition.

###### A.1.4.9.2.1.1 - Warning Notice [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0222d1c6-67ab-456e-82d6-41f3b834f285 -->

Formal warnings are issued publicly, and justification and reasoning must be provided by the Core Facilitator.

###### A.1.4.9.2.1.2 - Warning Recording [Active Data Controller]  <!-- UUID: ba80af50-c233-418b-8ed0-88dad26a9dc9 -->

Formal warnings are recorded by adding the identity and known aliases or associated entities to the Active Data list in [A.1.4.9.2.1.2.0.6.1 - List of Formally Warned Alignment Conservers](beb9ed67-660b-4ac5-84fe-a5644df957ac).

The Active Data is updated as follows:

- The Responsible Party is the Core Facilitator.

- The Update Process must follow the protocol for ‘Alignment Conserver Changes’.

###### A.1.4.9.2.1.0.4.1 - Adjudication Guidelines to be applied to a second misaligned act or a first misaligned act that is not mild [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 98407e43-d462-4aae-b0b4-89e110a6152c -->

The Target Document fails to specify accountability measures for an AC who commits a misaligned act that is not mild. The Target Document is also silent on the subject of the proper remedial approach if an AC commits a subsequent misaligned act after an initial mild breach. The language does imply subsequent breaches should be treated with increasing severity.

Despite the lack of explicit guidance, however, Facilitators have likely been given sufficient information in [A.1.4 - Alignment Conservers](df4f9bfd-e743-44b5-9c62-9c5f10b15340) to reach a reliable adjudication principle. 

Taken in its totality, the above cited Article requires Facilitators to take a highly aggressive stance when it comes to responding to AC misalignment risk. The absence of a substantial punitive measure for the first mild breach provides the AC with an opportunity for corrective action and learning. 

After the initial warning, any subsequent breach must immediately trigger derecognition, regardless of the degree of severity. Similarly, an initial breach that is not mild in scope or impact must trigger derecognition. This escalation is a necessary consequence of the Atlas's mandate that ACs are held to the highest standards of Universal Alignment.

###### A.1.4.9.2.1.0.4.2 - Mild Slippery Slope Breaches - Evaluating Whether A Misaligned Act Is ‘Very Mild' [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 27846f29-12dd-493e-9584-6091d30fb8cc -->

The element "mild slippery slope breach" characterizes a form of misalignment or rule breach that, when viewed in isolation, exhibits relatively insignificant scope or impact. Furthermore, a "very mild" act of misalignment often indicates a lack of ill intent (i.e., innocent mistake) or premeditation on the part of the rule violator. A "very mild slippery slope breach" will likely be the violator's first offense.

###### A.1.4.9.2.1.0.4.3 - Mild Slippery Slope Breaches - Facilitators Required To Be Proactive Against Even Mild Misalignment [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 9bf5a866-08bd-4519-88de-1749af02645c -->

Any Alignment Conserver misalignment, regardless of its seemingly trivial nature, carries inherent risks. ACs must be held to the highest standards of Universal Alignment. The Target Document indicates that leniency towards AC infractions could set a risky precedent, where, for instance, misaligned actors justify themselves based on prior instances of lenience.

##### A.1.4.9.2.2 - Mandated Derecognition For Severe Breaches [Core]  <!-- UUID: 12044fd7-4cfa-4431-aa03-a9531353c6dd -->

In cases where severe actions or violations occur that can be reasonably interpreted as Governance Attacks, the Alignment Conserver must be promptly derecognized by the Core Facilitator.

###### NR-7 - Defining “Severe Actions Or Violations" And “Governance Attack” [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: 98d5b899-f012-403d-9c6a-2ffda4ec2961 -->

**Content**:

What specific criteria or actions qualify as "severe" enough to warrant derecognition? Develop clear guidelines that define what constitutes a "severe case" in the context of misaligned actions. This involves identifying key indicators of severity, such as the magnitude of the impact, the intent behind the actions, and the potential or actual harm caused.

Also needed: What actions or behaviors specifically constitute a "Governance Attack"? Can you propose criteria or frameworks for assessing intent, the scope of actions, and their potential consequences? The research can perhaps explore how different governance models define and respond to attacks and consider psychological, legal, and operational perspectives to support a more fact-driven interpretive approach.

###### A.1.4.9.2.2.0.3.1 - Governance Attacks - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: c5bb1fc6-942f-4edc-818b-bf7aa75137c2 -->

The element "governance attack" is a critical violation of the Sky ecosystem's governance protocols, far surpassing minor breaches in scope and impact. This term is reserved for misaligned acts with the near-term potential to severely compromise the Ecosystem's foundational structure and operational integrity. In contrast to mild breaches, which may involve actors with unintentional or benign motivations, a Governance Attack is distinguished by its deliberate and premeditated nature. Actors orchestrating such attacks are likely driven by strategic intent, aiming to destabilize or exploit the governance framework for their own gain.

###### A.1.4.9.2.2.0.4.1 - Promptly Derecognized - Mandated Timeline For AC Derecognition For Misalignment [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: d7201212-e3f6-46a6-bab3-e859b88b0af2 -->

The element 'promptly' in the Target Document means 'as soon as is reasonably possible.'

To adhere to this commitment, the Core Facilitator must derecognize the AC within a general timeframe of 1-2 calendar days upon conclusion of an adjudication that finds against the AC for misalignment. Failure to meet this deadline requires a showing of good cause, demonstrating extenuating circumstances beyond the Facilitators’ control.

#### A.1.4.9.3 - Issuing of Public Report [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8d8dfab8-1350-42e7-bc20-3ae2eca86005 -->

Where feasible, the Core Facilitator should issue a report at the conclusion of their adjudication. The report should be posted on the Sky Forum and should summarize the findings and reasoning supporting their decision.

##### A.1.4.9.3.0.4.1 - Where Feasible - Core Facilitator Have Discretion In Determining Whether Public Report Should Be Issued [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: f6f61fd9-9aec-4db4-b825-162098495376 -->

The element "where feasible" means that the Core Facilitator have discretion to determine whether it is appropriate to issue a Public Report following an AC misalignment adjudication. Where an adjudication proceeding involves sensitive security matters or evidence, the Core Facilitator have the option to defer from issuing a public report entirely; or to issue a report that excludes the sensitive security matters, while maintaining as much transparency as possible. The latter option should be preferred where possible.

#### A.1.4.9.4 - Core Facilitator Is Subject Of Misalignment Allegation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1fd1ecc3-49c6-4e8c-b1fe-4387460d3514 -->

If the Core Facilitator is the subject of an allegation of misalignment or operational security breach, the adjudication process may be initiated by Core GovOps.

#### A.1.4.9.0.4.1 - ACs Must Go Beyond Mere Technical Compliance With Rules [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 8d8980b8-3ac7-49c6-8bc9-f601733a3198 -->

Alignment Conservers (ACs) must meet the most stringent standards for Universal Alignment, demonstrating not only compliance with the letter of the rules but also a deep and authentic commitment to the spirit of the rules, i.e., the underlying principles and goals of Sky. This demanding standard goes beyond mere technical compliance and requires proof of genuine intent and actions consistent with upholding the Spirit of the Atlas. 

See [A.0.1.1.9 - Letter Of The Rule Vs Spirit Of The Rule](ff16fd74-3a81-4cac-92b4-1208d4d9f337).

#### A.1.4.9.0.4.2 - Doubt Regarding AC’s Alignment Will Be Resolved Against Them [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 3b516fa0-bc6f-4fae-8c98-274798ab858c -->

In adjudicating potential misalignment of Alignment Conservers, Facilitators are not to assume innocence or give leeway in cases of ambiguity. Instead, the burden is on the Alignment Conserver to provide clear and convincing evidence of their alignment. Any uncertainty or doubt regarding the AC’s alignment will be resolved against them, requiring them to definitively prove their adherence to the Atlas.

### A.1.4.10 - AC Derecognition [Section]  <!-- UUID: ac998664-5b5e-4ea5-813b-dc3105ea6cf2 -->

Derecognition is the ultimate accountability measure for misalignment and entails permanently removing the individual or entity from their role as an Alignment Conserver. An individual/entity who has been derecognized from a Facilitator role is not eligible to serve as an Aligned Delegate, and vice versa. 

The subdocuments herein define rules and processes related to Alignment Conserver Derecognition.

#### NR-9 - Derecognition Uncertainty Due To Anonymous Actors [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: 69e4df9f-d2f3-4fd2-9add-e1314a0a5eb3 -->

**Content**:

The Target Document defines the act of derecognition as "permanently removing" an entity from the Alignment Conserver role. In fact, it is not possible to effect such a permanent removal. Given the presence of anonymous/pseudonymous actors in the decentralized "workforce" of the Sky ecosystem, a known identity of an actor can be barred from an AC role; and yet that actor can easily re-enter the system under a different pseudonym or identity. Consider what measures can be implemented to counteract the scenario where derecognized entities reappear under a different guise. A robust reputation system is already planned; by tracking reputation that is earned over a long timescale, a derecognized entity would be barred from quickly regaining a foothold.

#### A.1.4.10.1 - Derecognition Notice [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9c05207d-5e11-43ae-a8a3-1b61734d6ef9 -->

Derecognition notices are issued publicly, and justification and reasoning must be provided by the Core Facilitator.

#### A.1.4.10.2 - Derecognition Recording [Active Data Controller]  <!-- UUID: 15def023-af2e-4a27-92c4-6fab7b6f02f6 -->

Derecognitions of Alignment Conservers are recorded by adding the identity and known aliases or associated entities to [A.1.4.10.2.0.6.1 - Derecognized Alignment Conservers](e7aec672-ed19-4329-aaf7-736950be2eb7).

The Active Data is updated as follows:

## A.1.5 - Aligned Delegates [Article]  <!-- UUID: 75f0063c-ad70-49e4-b356-9b76097ced7b -->

A type of Alignment Conserver, Aligned Delegates (ADs) possess considerable influence over the Sky Protocol through their control of delegated voting power. Their primary focus is to prevent the abuse of this power, whether by themselves or others, and to safeguard the ecosystem against misaligned actions from other actors or parts of the governance process. This Article defines key infrastructure and requirements concerning Aligned Delegates.

### A.1.5.1 - Core Facilitator Responsibilities [Section]  <!-- UUID: e4daca33-def9-4f9d-8f66-1f5df2f10659 -->

This Section defines specific responsibilities of the Core Facilitator with regard to Aligned Delegates.

#### A.1.5.1.1 - Mandate to Enforce Rules [Core]  <!-- UUID: 88a86033-29d9-497e-8d9e-9862680ee6b1 -->

The Core Facilitator must enforce all rules governing Aligned Delegates.

#### A.1.5.1.2 - Mandate to Maintain Application Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: e5117ac9-caef-4273-9c8a-fc815fa9b192 -->

The Core Facilitator must oversee and maintain the process by which individuals/entities apply for recognition as an Aligned Delegate.

#### A.1.5.1.3 - AD Recognition Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 07e63bc3-7ec9-499b-9e5e-2c5acf47cc11 -->

Applicants must be formally recognized as Aligned Delegates by the Core Facilitator upon fulfilling all requirements defined in the subdocuments herein.

##### A.1.5.1.3.1 - Contract Deployment [Core]  <!-- UUID: eeb4c881-79c3-4ba7-bfe7-6bc2ddd5873a -->

To be recognized as an Aligned Delegate, the applicant must deploy at least one (1) Delegate Contract. This should be done prior to posting their AD Recognition Submission Message pursuant to [A.1.5.1.3.2 - Submission Message](83289ee2-2685-4ef7-99f1-c064541c9e9f).

###### A.1.5.1.3.1.0.3.1 - Delegate Contract - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: e4e33492-44a0-447e-85be-dcbe506a8578 -->

The element "Delegate Contract" refers to a bespoke Sky smart contract that allows SKY holders to delegate the voting strength associated with their SKY holdings to a particular Aligned Delegate. Every Aligned Delegate has at least one Delegate Contract, with which they can cast votes in Sky Governance.

###### A.1.5.1.3.1.0.3.2 - Deploying A Delegate Contract - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 68f465e6-50f8-4e29-b7f7-418ae441896c -->

A prospective Aligned Delegate must deploy a new Delegate Contract(s) through the associated smart contract, using their chosen Ethereum address. To create a new Delegate Contract, an applicant should visit this page and connect an Ethereum wallet: [https://vote.sky.money/account](https://vote.sky.money/account).

An Aligned Delegate should deploy the new Delegate Contract(s) prior to posting a Submission Message on the Sky Forum pursuant to [A.1.5.1.3.2 - Submission Message](83289ee2-2685-4ef7-99f1-c064541c9e9f).

##### A.1.5.1.3.2 - Submission Message [Core]  <!-- UUID: 83289ee2-2685-4ef7-99f1-c064541c9e9f -->

To be recognized as an Aligned Delegate, the applicant must publicly post an AD Recognition Submission Message on the Sky Forum. 

This AD Recognition Submission Message must contain links to two (2) cryptographically signed messages as specified in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.1.5.1.3.2.1 - Cryptographically Signed Message By Ethereum Address Controlling Delegate Contract(s) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 01bed493-d114-432a-95c0-fb977524336c -->

The first message must be cryptographically signed by the applicant’s Ethereum address controlling the deployed Delegate Contract(s). The cryptographically signed message demonstrates that the applicant controls the Ethereum address that, in turn, controls their deployed Delegate Contract(s).

This first message must include the following elements to be valid:

1. A title of "Aligned Delegate Recognition - Delegate Contract", and

2. A timestamp recording the time and date that the message was cryptographically signed.

###### A.1.5.1.3.2.2 - Cryptographically Signed Message By Ecosystem Actor Ethereum Address [Core]  <!-- UUID: 34cb5468-71a1-4fe6-8e6b-49a500aa2af8 -->

The second message must be cryptographically signed by the applicant’s Ecosystem Actor Ethereum address.

This second message must include the following elements to be valid:

1. A title of "Aligned Delegate Recognition - Ecosystem Actor Address", and

2. A timestamp recording the time and date that the message was cryptographically signed.

###### A.1.5.1.3.2.0.3.1 - Cryptographically Signed Messages - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 5105cf0b-0f3b-4b84-8603-430f65d2caf7 -->

A simple way to provide the required cryptographically signed messages is to use the Verified Signature on-chain mechanism hosted by Etherscan ([https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures](https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures)). The cryptographic verification comes from the prospective Aligned Delegate "signing" or validating the messages using their chosen Ethereum address. In addition, the cryptographically signed messages should contain the required elements (titles and timestamps) to be valid. The required elements are specified in the Target Document.

##### A.1.5.1.3.3 - AD Submission Message Template [Core]  <!-- UUID: a1eeced2-16b8-40b1-8539-48e1c7fe55cc -->

The AD Recognition Submission Message on the Sky Forum must follow this template:

Title: AD Recognition Submission
[Ecosystem Actor Ethereum address]
[Ethereum address of Delegate Contract]
[Cryptographically signed AD Recognition Submission Message from the Ethereum address controlling Delegate Contract]
[Cryptographically signed AD Recognition Submission Message from the Ecosystem Actor Ethereum address, where this address is not an address controlling a Delegate Contract]

#### A.1.5.1.4 - List Of Recognized Aligned Delegates [Active Data Controller]  <!-- UUID: 79e4e209-2925-4074-95f5-28544117c680 -->

The list of currently recognized Aligned Delegates is defined as Active Data in [A.1.5.1.4.0.6.1 - Current Aligned Delegates](5f584db8-f8d8-4118-988c-b2bc3f68ceb7).

##### A.1.5.3.1.3 - Level 3 Ranked Delegates [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8b4d704c-4dcb-47c9-aadd-68255e61bb6a -->

Level 3 Ranked Delegates are eligible for a lower budget and are expected to contribute to the Sky Protocol at a lower level relative to other Ranked Delegates.

###### A.1.5.3.1.3.1 - Number Of Level 3 Ranked Delegates [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8833de34-7904-4624-8396-9ee27a4743fc -->

There are three (3) Level 3 Ranked Delegates.

###### A.1.5.3.1.3.2 - Budget For Level 3 Ranked Delegates  [Core]  <!-- UUID: c51b75e1-8390-46c6-b455-3fd1b155af0d -->

Each Level 3 Ranked Delegate is eligible for a budget of 48,000 USDS per year.

###### A.1.5.3.1.3.3 - Selection Of Level 3 Ranked Delegates [Core]  <!-- UUID: c3ad0b9f-970a-4495-9640-2553e77ea8ab -->

The Level 3 Ranked Delegates are the Aligned Delegates with the greatest delegated Voting Power who are not Level 1 Ranked Delegates or Level 2 Ranked Delegates.

###### A.1.5.3.1.3.3.0.3.1 - Delegated Voting Power - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 8012ae3b-bcd7-4fdc-a93c-8c33d770a7ca -->

The element "delegated Voting Power" refers to the cumulative SKY that has been delegated to an Aligned Delegate's Delegate Contract by SKY holders and Staking users.

#### A.1.5.3.2 - Budget Accrual [Core]  <!-- UUID: e16ac70b-5c9c-4a45-8bae-852be2b5b5e0 -->

The budget for Ranked Delegates accrues on a continuous basis.

#### A.1.5.3.3 - Budget Contingency [Core]  <!-- UUID: 82f74f4b-8c49-4b1e-9ae7-f6c5e23d3394 -->

A Ranked Delegate's allocated budget can be reduced if they do not fully comply with the participation requirements defined in this Article at Voting-Activity Metrics, Voting-Communication Metrics, and Emergency Communications Requirement.

##### A.1.5.3.3.1 - Voting-Activity Metrics [Core]  <!-- UUID: ad1ef0f4-246f-4289-b5fc-ea5c91508ccf -->

The budget allocated to a Ranked Delegate (RD) is modified based on their voting-activity metrics over the past six (6) months. This budget modification takes into account the overall participation of the Ranked Delegate in all votes they are eligible to cast as an Aligned Delegate (AD).

If an RD participates in less than 95% of all eligible votes within the last six (6) months, their RD budget is reduced. The reduction is applied on a proportional linear scale: for every percentage point below 95% voting activity, the RD’s budget is reduced correspondingly.

Should an RD's voting activity fall to 75% of all eligible votes within the last six (6) months, they become completely ineligible to receive RD income. If the RD is a Level 3 Ranked Delegate, their RD rank, and the budget eligibility associated with that rank, is transferred to the next highest-ranking AD, as determined by total amount of SKY delegated to their Delegate Contract.

###### A.1.5.3.3.1.0.3.1  - Proportional Linear Scale - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 57a0be8f-c0d8-4d0c-bb99-ca3e63da5058 -->

The element "proportional linear scale" describes a method where the budget reduction is directly proportional to the decline in voting-communication activity between 95% and 75%. Here, the pertinent range of voting-communication activity spans from 95% to 75%, which is 20 percentage points. The budget decreases linearly across these 20 percentage points. In other words, the RD budget decreases by **5%** for every percentage point drop in voting-communication activity from 95% to 75% (since 100% divided by 20 percentage points = 5% per point).

##### A.1.5.3.3.2 - Voting-Communication Metrics [Core]  <!-- UUID: f020d1bc-8905-46f8-b3a5-c31bcc0eec79 -->

The budget allocated to a Ranked Delegate (RD) is modified based on their voting-communication metrics over the past six (6) months. An AD is required to provide an explanation for each vote they participate in. This budget modification takes into account the Ranked Delegate’s fulfillment of this voting-communication requirement in all votes they are eligible to cast as an Aligned Delegate (AD).

If an RD provides the required voting-communication on less than 95% of all eligible votes within the last six (6) months, their RD budget stream is reduced. The reduction is applied on a proportional linear scale: for every percentage point below 95% voting-communication activity, the RD’s budget is reduced correspondingly.

Should an RD's voting-communication activity fall to 75% of all eligible votes within the last six (6) months, they become completely ineligible to receive RD income. If the RD is a Level 3 Ranked Delegate, their RD rank, and the budget eligibility associated with that rank, is transferred to the next highest-ranking AD, as determined by total amount of SKY delegated to their Delegate Contract.

###### NR-12 - Criteria For AD Voting-Communication Requirement [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: ea34cf2b-b756-4c55-b317-7e4802b6f9b3 -->

**Content**:

For the purpose of enforcing the Target Document, should there be explicit criteria for Aligned Delegates' voting-communications? What constitutes an adequate explanation for each vote? How would the Core Facilitator evaluate ADs' explanations for quality, completeness, etc.? How can the Core Facilitator objectively assess explanations that may vary widely in style and content?

How might ADs' explanations vary across different types of votes, and should the criteria reflect these differences? Should more complex or high-stakes votes require more detailed explanations than routine or procedural votes?

What feedback mechanisms should be in place to help ADs improve their explanations?

What are the risks of not having explicit criteria for voting-communications? One is the potential failure of the Target Document's objective to ensure that ADs' voting activity is transparent to SKY holders who have delegated to that AD.

###### A.1.5.3.3.2.0.3.1 - Proportional Linear Scale - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 57c35484-4c5f-4349-a7fe-097618b4213a -->

The element "proportional linear scale" describes a method where the budget reduction is directly proportional to the decline in voting activity between 95% and 75%. Here, the pertinent range of voting activity spans from 95% to 75%, which is 20 percentage points. The budget decreases linearly across these 20 percentage points. In other words, the RD budget decreases by **5%** for every percentage point drop in voting activity from 95% to 75% (since 100% divided by 20 percentage points = 5% per point).

###### A.1.5.3.3.2.0.3.2 - Voting-Communication Metrics - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: ca88baad-2457-4454-9e34-367156a59e78 -->

The element "voting-communication metrics" refers to the percentage of votes for which an Aligned Delegate provides the required written explanations or justifications of their casted votes in Governance Polls and Executive Votes. These written explanations are posted in the AD's Forum thread. 

The Target Document’s function is to ensure that SKY holders delegating to the AD have full transparency to understand the AD's decision-making process.

##### A.1.5.3.3.3 - Emergency Communications Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: 43db9780-6c0a-458a-94c2-5951b5b80787 -->

The budget stream allocated to a Ranked Delegate (RD) is modified based on their correct usage of required tools for emergency communications.

Should an RD fail to correctly use the required communications tools, they become completely ineligible to receive RD income. If the RD is a Level 3 Ranked Delegate, their RD rank, and the budget eligibility associated with that rank, is transferred to the next highest-ranking AD, as determined by total amount of SKY delegated to their Delegate Contract.

###### A.1.5.3.3.3.1 - Signal Account Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: 21d0b626-cd84-4237-8cab-d68f697c276d -->

RDs are required to maintain an active Signal account to facilitate communications related to emergency / urgent situations. This requirement applies regardless of whether an RD has been appointed to the Emergency Response Group. See [A.1.8.1.3.1 - Emergency Response Signal Group](45a7ccff-09fa-4d95-b3d8-e3f34f7917cf). RDs must provide their Signal username to the Core Facilitator.

The Core Facilitator is responsible for maintaining an internal registry of RDs' Signal accounts. Because the ranked RDs are continually changing, the Core Facilitator must ensure that the internal registry is maintained on a frequent basis. The Core Facilitator must check the active status of the RDs' Signal accounts by sending test messages and confirming the RDs' timely response; this must be done regularly, on a schedule known only to the Core Facilitator. If an RD fails to timely respond to the test messages, the Core Facilitator must remove them from RD status.

#### A.1.5.3.4 - AD Buffer [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0625cdd6-f089-47ab-ad3e-209e14064951 -->

The AD Buffer is an account of USDS that begins accumulating funds when an Aligned Delegate attains Ranked Delegate status. The budget allocated to the AD is credited to the AD Buffer. Funds within the AD Buffer cannot be accessed or spent until they reach a minimum threshold equivalent to one (1) month's budget allocation based on the current level of the Ranked Delegate.

Once this threshold is met, the AD will receive payouts from the AD Buffer to the address that controls the AD Delegate Contract. ADs may use this budget for various purposes, including personal compensation, compensation for team members, research expenses, and other relevant activities.

##### A.1.5.3.4.1 - AD Monthly Compensation Cycle [Core]  <!-- UUID: 688247c6-c4ed-49e3-96f3-c6a7475d89eb -->

Aligned Delegates are eligible to receive payments from their AD Buffers in a monthly compensation cycle. The Core Facilitator is responsible for calculating the payout due to each Aligned Delegate.

This includes calculating:

1. the Aligned Delegates ranked as Level 3 Ranked Delegates on a daily basis;
2. the budget to be deposited into each Aligned Delegate's AD Buffer, which is modified pursuant to voting and communication metrics;
3. the balance of each Delegate's AD Buffer; and
4. the amount to be paid out to each Aligned Delegate.
5. Once calculated by the Core Facilitator, AD payouts are paid from the Aligned Delegates Buffer Multisig. See [A.2.3.1.4.1.2.1 - Aligned Delegates Buffer](05fa5c41-26ca-4c25-94dd-834ef72c318a).

###### NR-10 - AD Budget Management [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: 6502ce76-3f29-4f50-a68c-9126feba1fb6 -->

**Content**:

Are there risks that should be considered regarding the potential mismanagement or misuse of the AD budget? The Target Document lists several examples of permissible ways to use the AD budget, which indicates implicitly constraints, or disallowed expenditures. How would compliance with these guidelines be monitored?

###### A.1.5.3.4.1.1 - One Month's Budget Allocation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 48a2c0f5-5f09-44d3-a930-47e6c12fb901 -->

##### A.1.5.3.4.2 - AD Buffer And Loss Of Budget [Core]  <!-- UUID: add0e307-9fbb-4871-9eab-c7bd18662e01 -->

If an AD is unranked for an entire month, any contents in its AD Buffer can be paid out in the next monthly compensation cycle, except as specified in [A.1.5.3.4.2.1 - Payout Limitations For ADs Triggering Atlas Edit Proposals](8eca5ff8-8798-465b-b86a-f9ee5c93f213).

###### A.1.5.3.4.2.1 - Payout Limitations For ADs Triggering Atlas Edit Proposals [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8eca5ff8-8798-465b-b86a-f9ee5c93f213 -->

If an AD has triggered an Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal pursuant to [A.1.10.2.1.3 - Triggering Requirement](cef09d74-efc6-45cc-a75b-1132dae9e743), or [A.1.11.2.1.2 - Triggering Requirement](7bbfd3b1-99b5-4c60-9292-68d776e03886), respectively, no payouts may be made that would reduce their AD Buffer below the [A.1.5.3.4.2.1.1 - Triggering Threshold](2c2b201e-b95f-4852-8e76-6dfe4c3c6a4f) specified in Triggering Threshold until the Proposal has been voted on or rejected by the Core Facilitator for misalignment.

###### A.1.5.3.4.2.1.1 - Triggering Threshold [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2c2b201e-b95f-4852-8e76-6dfe4c3c6a4f -->

The Triggering Threshold is the amount of USDS that a Ranked Delegate must have in its AD Buffer to trigger Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle or Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle Proposals. See [A.1.10.2.1.3 - Triggering Requirement](cef09d74-efc6-45cc-a75b-1132dae9e743) and [A.1.11.2.1.2 - Triggering Requirement](7bbfd3b1-99b5-4c60-9292-68d776e03886). The Triggering Threshold is equal to one (1) month of compensation based on the budget for Level 3 Ranked Delegates specified in [A.1.5.3.1.3.2 - Budget For Level 3 Ranked Delegates](c51b75e1-8390-46c6-b455-3fd1b155af0d).

##### A.1.5.3.4.3 - Deduction Of Penalties From AD Buffer [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4a29dd32-2333-471a-bea1-1aa0f5413453 -->

If the Core Facilitator finds that an AD has conducted a misaligned act warranting financial penalties or derecognition, such penalties may be deducted from the AD’s Buffer.

### A.1.5.4 - Kickbacks Prohibited [Section]  <!-- UUID: 45e794a0-5092-4dea-a0de-6f373228f760 -->

Aligned Delegates are not allowed to provide "kickbacks" from their compensation to SKY holders who delegate to them. Violation of this requirement constitutes misalignment.

### A.1.5.5 - Swift Action Is Required From Facilitators To Redress AD Misalignment [Section]  <!-- UUID: 8953d5dc-1344-4fec-ae25-693204f64e38 -->

The Facilitator must act swiftly when an AD is suspected of breaching the requirements defined in this Article, or the requirements defined in [A.1.4 - Alignment Conservers](df4f9bfd-e743-44b5-9c62-9c5f10b15340).

Any Scope Facilitator has the authority to formally raise an allegation of AD misalignment with the Core Facilitator, which then obligates the latter to initiate a formal adjudication pursuant to [A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process](560e1024-0897-4f1e-ae71-3ba31e29ed57).

A Facilitator's failure to act promptly in addressing credible evidence of AD misalignment or to mitigate the risk of misalignment spreading among ADs is considered an act of misalignment itself. Formal allegations of such failure must be adjudicated by the Core Facilitator pursuant to the same process referenced in the above-cited document.

#### A.1.5.5.0.4.1 - Facilitators’ Authority To Raise Formal Allegation [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: c5146fa6-00ec-4543-9288-410570b5d588 -->

Any community member or Aligned Delegate with information pertinent to suspected Alignment Conserver misalignment may take their concerns directly to the Core Facilitator.  Upon receiving such information, the Core Facilitator must promptly conduct an initial review to quickly assess the credibility of the concern. Based on this preliminary review, the Core Facilitator must decide whether to initiate a formal adjudication process in accordance with [A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process](560e1024-0897-4f1e-ae71-3ba31e29ed57).

Where the allegation of misalignment concerns the Core Facilitator, a community member can take their concerns to Core GovOps, who is then empowered to initiate the formal adjudication process.

### A.1.5.6 - Mandate To Maintain High Level of Operational Security [Section]  <!-- UUID: c68b4c5d-adf7-49e6-850a-17a688664d40 -->

Aligned Delegates (ADs) are required to maintain a high level of operational security, adhering to best practices in privacy, cybersecurity, and physical resilience. These measures must be implemented at a level that sufficiently safeguards the Sky Ecosystem from physical risk posed by the potential for attacks against ADs. ADs’ operational security protocols should be regularly reviewed and updated to address emerging risks and ensure continuous protection of the ecosystem.

### A.1.5.7 - Derecognition Required Where AD Operational Security Is Compromised [Section]  <!-- UUID: 7b0da718-62c1-4718-8d9d-47faa1647c6f -->

All Facilitators must act swiftly to investigate ADs who are suspected of breaching their requirements regarding operational security and privacy.

Any Scope Facilitator has the authority to formally raise an allegation concerning AD breach of operational security with the Core Facilitator, which then obligates the latter to initiate a formal adjudication pursuant to [A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process](560e1024-0897-4f1e-ae71-3ba31e29ed57).

If there is clear evidence or significant suspicion that the operational security of an AD has been compromised, or that they have failed to follow best practice or otherwise made operational security errors, the Core Facilitator must promptly derecognize the AD.

#### A.1.5.7.0.4.1 - Promptly Derecognized - Mandated Timeline For AD Derecognition For Operational Security Breach [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 36e7c024-0156-4941-a9f2-f53ce25ef39f -->

The element 'promptly' in the Target Document means 'as soon as is reasonably possible.'

To adhere to this commitment, the Core Facilitator must derecognize the AD within a general timeframe of 1-2 calendar days upon conclusion of an investigation that finds against the AD for breach of operational security. Failure to meet this deadline requires a showing of good cause, demonstrating extenuating circumstances beyond the Facilitators’ control.

### A.1.5.8 - Facilitators Must Err On Side Of Caution [Section]  <!-- UUID: 09efe31d-28ae-47cc-a81e-caf4f669df95 -->

Facilitators are required to err on the side of caution and take action whenever there is any real possibility that the operational security of an Aligned Delegate (AD) is compromised. Facilitators are afforded significant discretion in making judgement calls related to operational security standards for ADs. 

Abuse of this power is severe misalignment. Any allegations of this abuse of power must be adjudicated by the Core Facilitator pursuant to the process defined in [A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process](560e1024-0897-4f1e-ae71-3ba31e29ed57).

### A.1.5.9 - Emergency Contact Mechanism [Section]  <!-- UUID: d5d4cc4a-8877-4931-861f-056793387b92 -->

Aligned Delegates must safeguard the security of the Sky Protocol through the Executive Vote process. To deal with emergencies related to Executive Votes, ADs are required to sign up for the approved emergency contact mechanism specified in [A.1.8.1.3.2.2 - Approved Emergency Contact Mechanisms](57006d4e-cd91-4565-97b5-5fab73fa94d5). 

ADs must strictly adhere to all onboarding procedures and usage instructions associated with this emergency contact mechanism. ADs that fail to do so will be considered in misalignment and will be derecognized.

The high operational security requirements applicable to ADs extend to their use of the emergency contact mechanism.

The element 'promptly' in the Target Document means 'as soon as is reasonably possible.'

To adhere to this commitment, the Core Facilitator must derecognize the Facilitator within a general timeframe of 1-2 calendar days upon conclusion of an investigation that finds against the Facilitator. Failure to meet this deadline requires a showing of good cause, demonstrating extenuating circumstances beyond the Facilitators’ control.

### A.1.6.5 - Facilitators Must Err On Side Of Caution [Section]  <!-- UUID: ac9df70a-d110-42da-805a-abe03b52dcdc -->

The Core Facilitator is required to err on the side of caution and take action whenever there is any real possibility that the operational security of a Facilitator is compromised. The Core Facilitator is afforded significant discretion in making judgement calls related to operational security standards for Facilitators.

Abuse of this power is severe misalignment. Any allegations of this abuse of power must be adjudicated by Core GovOps pursuant to the process defined in [A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process](560e1024-0897-4f1e-ae71-3ba31e29ed57).

### A.1.6.6 - Acting Against Misalignment [Section]  <!-- UUID: 7aafa61e-8649-41fb-8c3f-64e5714f9f18 -->

The Core Facilitator is empowered with broad discretion in addressing situations where an Alignment Conserver, Ecosystem Actor or other relevant governance participant's actions are misaligned. See [A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process](560e1024-0897-4f1e-ae71-3ba31e29ed57), which defines the adjudication process that the Core Facilitator must follow in addressing Alignment Conserver misalignment.

The Core Facilitators' abuse of this discretionary power is severe misalignment. Any allegations of this abuse of power must be adjudicated by Core GovOps pursuant to the process defined in the above-cited document.

The Core Facilitator's failure to act promptly in addressing credible evidence of misalignment is considered an act of misalignment itself. Formal allegations of such failure must be adjudicated by Core GovOps to the same process referenced in the above-cited document.

#### NR-17 - Addressing Misalignment Of Ecosystem Actors Or Other Governance Participants [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: 9962c7cc-9df2-4c37-89d6-746d004a056d -->

**Content**:

Currently, the Atlas specifies an adjudication process for Alignment Conserver misalignment or breach of operational security. Research is needed to consider a process by which Facilitators investigate and adjudicate suspected misalignment on the part of Ecosystem Actors or other governance participants.

### A.1.6.7 - Justification For Operational Decisions [Section]  <!-- UUID: 36be7725-ea36-4e37-a363-856a69d6ef2d -->

The Core Facilitator must ensure that their decisions related to ordinary operations are clearly explained and justified using publicly available information. The Core Facilitator is generally prohibited from basing their decisions on internal knowledge or undisclosed data that is not accessible to the public.

Limited exceptions to this rule apply when Facilitators' decisions involve sensitive security matters. However, even in these situations, the Core Facilitator should ensure that the rationale for their decision is communicated in a manner that respects security concerns while maintaining as much transparency as possible.

#### A.1.6.7.0.3.1 - Internal Knowledge - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 4fbdf196-910c-4431-bdaa-f85f38bb4580 -->

## A.1.8 - Emergency Response System [Article]  <!-- UUID: 1d940c6d-02ce-4c17-8057-cef13c1cc7ad -->

This Article defines a general emergency response protocol for managing emergencies or urgent situations outside of the standard Weekly Governance Cycle and Monthly Governance Cycle.

### A.1.8.1 - Emergency Response [Section]  <!-- UUID: 20dcf582-8862-48b3-9ca9-c3703871bd14 -->

The Sky Protocol has often required changes outside of the standard Weekly Governance Cycle and Monthly Governance Cycle to help maintain the peg or to quickly respond to changes in the Ecosystem. This Section defines a general protocol for handling emergency or urgent situations.

[A.1.9.5 - Emergency Spells](b8266c11-3a84-4bbe-abe2-de9474f74ffd) governs the resolution of emergency / urgent situations involving the Executive Process.

#### A.1.8.1.1 - Definition Of Emergency Situations [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5eafb29e-84a0-4a53-a798-3f958c880225 -->

An emergency situation is any situation that would require immediate intervention to prevent initiation of Emergency Shutdown, severe peg divergence, or harm to members and users of the Ecosystem.

Pursuant to [A.0.1.2.1 - Facilitators’ Broad Discretionary Capacity](f18229fe-fbc3-4dc8-ad84-4bca2915f6c4), the Facilitators have broad discretion to apply the emergency-situation processes defined in [A.1.8.1 - Emergency Response](20dcf582-8862-48b3-9ca9-c3703871bd14) to urgent situations. Urgent situations are defined as any situation that involves a time-sensitive matter that would need an expedited governance process, where following a standard governance cycle would be too slow, risk a larger problem, or constitute an important missed opportunity.

#### A.1.8.1.2 - Emergency Response Group [Core]  <!-- UUID: d91720f8-8d9f-47f2-be80-c3dcaf8d216d -->

Emergency response is coordinated by the Emergency Response Group ("ERG"). The Emergency Response Group is a group of Facilitators, Aligned Delegates, and Ecosystem Actors that include domain experts in different areas of the Sky Ecosystem. The Emergency Response Group is tasked with reacting to emergency scenarios that are critical to the survival of the Sky Protocol.

##### A.1.8.1.2.1 - Emergency Response Group Membership Criteria [Core]  <!-- UUID: f83f2e87-6a6b-4afb-aa4c-d6d41a4a1cbc -->

The membership of the Emergency Response Group may change at the discretion of Scope Facilitators, and as circumstances require. Generally, the Emergency Response Group should contain domain-expert Ecosystem Actors as well as governance decision-makers. The group must be able to diagnose a situation, suggest a short-term mitigation and act on such mitigation. The group should also be able to define the path forward for a long-term solution to the problem and act on it.

##### A.1.8.1.2.2 - Emergency Response Group Membership [Active Data Controller]  <!-- UUID: 6ad02ee6-bd7a-4557-a768-178656037162 -->

A unique Signal "Emergency Response" Group will be used for all incident response coordination.

TechOps Services will create the Signal Group and assign its administrators.

The Support Facilitators and the Protocol Security Workstream Lead shall manage access to the Signal Group. All Emergency Response Members must be added to the Group.

Where an Emergency Response Group Member is a team, the two (2) team members responsible for incident response are required to join the Signal Group.

The Signal Group should not be used for any purpose except communications concerning a potential emergency situation. The Group must be configured to have a four-week message retention.

##### A.1.8.1.3.2 - Emergency Contact Mechanism [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3efb0238-aaae-4351-9ec9-31902f3a1394 -->

Emergency Response Group Members must use an emergency contact mechanism to deal with emergencies. This emergency contact mechanism is selected and validated by the Protocol Security Workstream Lead.

###### A.1.8.1.3.2.1 - Emergency Contact Mechanism Selection Criteria [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7baa8295-5509-4378-bcf9-842fda9a1365 -->

A suitable emergency contact mechanism should meet the following criteria:

- The mechanism should use enterprise grade infrastructure with correspondingly high levels of uptime.

- The mechanism should not require personal information or KYC from users.

- The mechanism should allow segmenting of target user groups, so that required individuals are only notified when necessary.

- The mechanism should be able to bypass silent / do not disturb mode on devices to achieve an immediate response any time of day.

- It is recommended, but not required, that the mechanism minimizes data tracking of individual users.

- It is recommended, but not required, that the mechanism is open source.

###### A.1.8.1.3.2.2 - Approved Emergency Contact Mechanisms [Core]  <!-- UUID: 57006d4e-cd91-4565-97b5-5fab73fa94d5 -->

The currently approved emergency contact mechanism is PagerDuty.

###### A.1.8.1.3.2.3 - Changes To Approved Emergency Contact Mechanisms [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0b6f25c1-fc39-44dc-bd6a-fc612cdb826e -->

The Governance Facilitators may recommend changing the approved emergency contact mechanism specified in [A.1.8.1.3.2.2 - Approved Emergency Contact Mechanisms](57006d4e-cd91-4565-97b5-5fab73fa94d5), but they must do so in consultation with the Protocol Security Workstream Lead. The Governance Facilitators’ recommendation is subject to a poll through the Operational Weekly Governance Cycle.

###### A.1.8.1.3.2.4 - Emergency Contact Mechanism Fire Drills [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4627de70-9866-41b8-be8e-68e9ca809a45 -->

The Protocol Security Workstream Lead and Governance Facilitators may run firedrills to test the preparedness of individuals that have been added to the emergency contact mechanism. This will be done at the discretion of the Protocol Security Workstream Lead and Governance Facilitators. The results of firedrills shall be published to maintain transparency.

#### A.1.8.1.4 - Facilitators’ Roles And Responsibilities [Core]  <!-- UUID: c9c32f24-cf6c-43d5-ac4c-bd2b4d02032b -->

The Support Facilitators are empowered to declare an emergency situation, in consultation with the responsible Facilitator of the impacted Scope(s) and, if relevant, the Core Council Risk Advisor.

After an emergency situation has been declared, the Support or Governance Facilitators are responsible for coordinating emergency-situation processes to ensure they are civil, consistently applied and aligned. The Governance Facilitators are responsible for publishing Polls and Executive Votes.

Any participant in the Sky Ecosystem, including Ecosystem Actors, Aligned Delegates or other community members, can request that the Support Facilitators declare an emergency. The Support Facilitators are granted broad discretion in handling such requests.

##### A.1.8.1.4.1 - Considerations Before Expediting Protocol Changes [Core]  <!-- UUID: f1587c7c-4913-46f8-90ab-6c1afc2ec316 -->

The Facilitators are required to consider several important factors before expediting changes to the protocol:

- Potential for SKY holders to miss a poll or Executive Vote due to departure from the standard governance cycles.

- Expedited votes may not allow for sufficient discussion, leading to a sub-optimal solution.

- Increased governance burden on community and increased workload for domain teams.

- Frequent expedited votes may signal a lack of appreciation for a consistent and predictable governance process.

#### A.1.8.1.5 - Emergency Response Process Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 498e151e-5096-4d0f-b9a9-665897b0b861 -->

The subdocuments herein define the emergency response process.

##### A.1.8.1.5.1 - Incident Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 97020aa2-9492-4fa4-8eee-d860d6f33618 -->

The Support Facilitators are responsible for determining whether a reported incident is a valid emergency; where possible, this can be done in consultation with the responsible Facilitator of the impacted Scope(s) and, if relevant, the Core Council Risk Advisor.

##### A.1.8.1.5.2 - Incident Categorization [Core]  <!-- UUID: f3a647b2-8083-41f1-b67a-66bd322ccc16 -->

The Support Facilitators are responsible for categorizing emergencies according to their severity and other pertinent criteria.

##### A.1.8.1.5.3 - Emergency-Contact Mechanism Trigger [Core]  <!-- UUID: 34a3d273-ce49-4147-adf3-6d52b4a2fad5 -->

Upon receiving notification from the Support Facilitators of a validated and categorized emergency situation, TechOps Services must trigger a notification in the Emergency Contact Mechanism specified in [A.1.8.1.3.2 - Emergency Contact Mechanism](3efb0238-aaae-4351-9ec9-31902f3a1394). All Emergency Response Group Members are required to acknowledge the incident in a timely manner through the Emergency Contact Mechanism. The notification must include a link to the official Emergency Response video call ("war room").

##### A.1.8.1.5.4 - Emergency Response Video Call Coordination [Core]  <!-- UUID: e46bca7a-ddc5-4c5a-826e-3d9dab8a9709 -->

Emergency Response Group Members are required to promptly join the Video Call to coordinate incident response.

###### A.1.8.1.5.4.1 - Known And Uncontentious Remedies [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3f5f79fa-698c-42db-a941-ead5a5d0aa48 -->

If a remedy is known and uncontentious, the Support or Governance Facilitators shall coordinate with the necessary Ecosystem Actors to expedite an Executive Vote.

##### A.1.8.1.5.5 - Emergency Declaration Procedure [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8ce1adeb-ec38-40ba-9a0d-bc0e0db4fece -->

The Support Facilitators are empowered to declare an emergency situation at their discretion, either on their own initiative or in response to a request from a community member.

When declaring an emergency, the Support Facilitators should create a formal post on the Sky Forum which provides sufficient detail regarding the issue and explains why immediate action is required. If the situation allows, Facilitators should post the emergency declaration on the Sky Forum before taking action. If the urgency of the situation requires immediate intervention without delay, the Facilitators should create the Forum post as soon as possible after, or simultaneously with, the emergency action.

There may be situations in which a public Emergency Declaration would be counterproductive to security objectives; the Support Facilitators are granted discretion in these matters.

Creating a signal request thread or Governance Poll is optional.

##### A.1.8.1.5.6 - Record Retention [Core]  <!-- UUID: ddab726d-7ecb-4028-bd85-964966d5d1ed -->

To achieve continuous improvement of emergency response processes, records should be retained post-incident to enable review of actions taken during the incident response. Such records may include but are not limited to:

1. An incident response template filled in with information from the coordination meeting;

2. Incident artifacts, including files, screenshots, documents, and links;

3. Chat transcripts from the approved communication channels specified in [A.1.8.1.3 - Emergency Response Communication Channels](18418289-ada8-401d-a992-7e38b235c866).

It is at the discretion of the Support Facilitators as to whether incident records can be shared with entities outside of the Emergency Response Group.

#### A.1.8.1.6 - Accountability For Emergency Response Preparedness [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8df982ee-754c-4cd9-a5f9-ce1c30e06cf8 -->

Emergency preparedness is a critical priority. The Support Facilitators, in consultation with the Protocol Security Workstream Lead, must regularly evaluate the emergency preparedness of the Emergency Response Group. This can be done through running fire drills or through extensive postmortems after an actual incident.

##### A.1.8.1.6.1 - Accountability Measures for Ecosystem Actor Individuals And Teams [Core]  <!-- UUID: 665b3bc4-9146-4d47-adaf-fcaff3aefe67 -->

For Ecosystem Actors appointed to the Emergency Response Group, fulfilling the responsibilities of this role is as critical to their overall performance evaluation as their customary deliverables.

The Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are required to document all instances of Emergency Response Group Members’ failure to meet emergency-preparedness requirements. Given their domain expertise and proximity to each emergency situation, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are granted the discretion to evaluate emergency-preparedness deficiencies. Generally, they are required to take swift action to address non-negligible emergency-preparedness deficiencies in the following manner.

If the deficient Emergency Response Group Member is an Ecosystem Actor individual, the individual should be removed from the Group.

If the deficient Emergency Response Group Member is part of an Ecosystem Actor team, the specific member who has failed to meet requirements should be removed from the Group.

If different Emergency Response Group Members from the same Ecosystem Actor team consistently fail to meet requirements, the Ecosystem Actor team as a whole should be removed from the Group.

The removal of a Member from the Group is done at the discretion of the Support Facilitators and the Protocol Security Workstream Lead. However, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead may not proceed with removal unless it is supported with clear documentation. Such documentation must be made available to all Emergency Response Group Members for review.

When an Ecosystem Actor is removed from the Emergency Response Group for deficient performance, the Support Facilitators must transparently announce this action via a post to the Sky Forum. Further, the removal must be incorporated into the evaluation of the Ecosystem Actor’s overall performance.

The Support Facilitators has the discretion to decide if documentation supporting the removal should be retained internally or publicly shared on the Forum (with redactions, if needed).

##### A.1.8.1.6.2 - Accountability Measures For Alignment Conservers [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2ce9cd30-8082-4470-965f-baa05c57b513 -->

For an Alignment Conserver who has been appointed to the Emergency Response Group, the requirements of this role become as critical to the assessment of their overall performance as their customary obligations.

The Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are required to document all instances of Emergency Response Group Members’ failure to meet emergency-preparedness requirements. Given their domain expertise and proximity to each emergency situation, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are granted the discretion to evaluate emergency-preparedness deficiencies. Generally, they are required to take swift action to address non-negligible emergency-preparedness deficiencies in the following manner.

Where the deficient Member is an Alignment Conserver, that Member should be derecognized pursuant to [A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process](560e1024-0897-4f1e-ae71-3ba31e29ed57).

Where the deficient Alignment Conserver is the Support Facilitators, the Protocol Security Workstream Lead and a majority of active Scope Facilitators must reach consensus in order to initiate a derecognition proceeding against the Support Facilitators. Once this threshold is met, the procedure defined in [A.1.4.9 - Adjudication Process](560e1024-0897-4f1e-ae71-3ba31e29ed57) should be followed. In the interim, other Scope Facilitators must step in temporarily to coordinate emergency response.

The initiation of derecognition is done at the discretion of the Support Facilitators (or other Scope Facilitator) and the Protocol Security Workstream Lead. However, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead may not proceed with removal unless it is supported with clear documentation. Such documentation must be made available to all Emergency Response Group Members for review.

When an Alignment Conserver is removed from the Emergency Response Group and derecognized for deficient performance, the Governance Facilitators must transparently announce this action pursuant to [A.1.4.10.1 - Derecognition Notice](9c05207d-5e11-43ae-a8a3-1b61734d6ef9).

The Support Facilitators have the discretion to decide if documentation supporting the Alignment Conserver’s derecognition and removal should be retained internally or publicly shared on the Forum (with redactions, if needed).

## A.1.9 - Sky Core Governance Security [Article]  <!-- UUID: de0cc370-de9c-48a4-b10e-91782df7abcd -->

This Article governs the correct and secure execution of Sky Governance processes for deploying and reviewing Executive Votes. This Article must protect against all forms of attacks, disruption and accidental failure by maximizing the transparency and resilience of the Sky Executive Process.

### A.1.9.1 - General Provisions [Section]  <!-- UUID: 41600516-1414-4c52-86f6-de8393911cfa -->

This Section contains general provisions related to Sky Core Governance Security.

#### A.1.9.1.1 - Spell Team Anonymity [Core]  <!-- UUID: f2bf066a-fdc6-4a3c-8375-24647c7fbed5 -->

The spell teams need not share their identities. Therefore, it is no longer a requirement that spell crafting teams publish the deployer of a smart contract. The spell Checklists have been amended accordingly.

#### A.1.9.1.2 - Chainlog [Core]  <!-- UUID: fa9145a8-308c-4732-927d-cb6da4682fcf -->

The Chainlog is an on-chain, governance-managed registry that records the official addresses of Sky’s core smart contracts. Each contract entry in the Chainlog is identified by a unique key ("Chainlog key"), which is used to reference the contract in documentation, governance actions, and integrations. It serves as the single source of truth for contract addresses in the protocol. The Chainlog is available at [https://chainlog.sky.money/](https://chainlog.sky.money/). Updates to the Chainlog are defined as housekeeping items (see [A.1.10.1.6.1.1 - Definition Of Housekeeping Items](7648bf12-d600-4e0d-807b-5eb18e8d0f4f)) and can be included directly in an Executive Vote (see [A.1.10.1.6.1.2 - Process for Adding Housekeeping Item In Executive Vote](2d165c27-5daf-4a84-af8c-7c36f5de03d2)).

### A.1.9.2 - Executive Process Definition [Section]  <!-- UUID: 03d32549-1da5-4a9c-902f-196641370eaf -->

This Section defines the Executive Process, which is the end-to-end process through which Sky makes changes to the Sky Protocol.

#### A.1.9.2.1 - Definitions [Core]  <!-- UUID: 324f379a-6341-4f39-aad5-f79f0d56812c -->

The documents herein contain common definitions that are relevant to the entirety of the Executive Process.

##### A.1.9.2.1.1 - Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: af04619b-5b0b-4762-86de-067550e079b9 -->

The Executive Sheet serves as a planning instrument and documentation for the agreed content of the Spell. It is therefore one of the foundational documents in the Executive Process. Each Spell has a dedicated Executive Sheet. The Governance Point creates a new Executive Sheet for each Executive Vote cycle, listing every executive item intended for inclusion in that cycle along with the provenance of each item. In this way, the Executive Sheet helps ensure transparency and verification in the Executive Process. Past Executive Sheets are preserved in order to provide a record of Executive Votes and their provenance.

The Executive Sheet (also referred to as the "exec sheet" or "sheet") is maintained on a large Google Sheets spreadsheet with several tabs. Each Executive Vote has its own tab, whose title is the designated Target Date for each spell.

The Executive Sheet provides a publicly visible list of plain-English instructions outlining the executive actions performed in a given spell. Each executive action is populated in the Executive Sheet under a column and broken down into input actions (high-level actions) and derived actions (resulting from input actions).

The Executive Sheet is used by several actors in the Executive Process. It is managed and populated by the Governance Point, used by stakeholders, who are required to provide confirmation for proposed executive items, and by the Spell Team. The Executive Sheet is the source of truth for the Spell Crafter who crafts the Spell based on its content. Only the Core Facilitators have write access to the Executive Sheet.

##### A.1.9.2.1.2 - Target Date [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2f06dd6a-8664-4916-8f82-5155d703d61a -->

The Target Date refers to the planned date when the Spell is expected to be made available to be voted on. The Target Date is decided by the Governance Point in collaboration with the Spell Crafter. Spells are usually deployed following a two-week cadence. Normally, the Target Date falls on Thursdays.

##### A.1.9.2.1.3 - Executive Document [Core]  <!-- UUID: a352b5e8-752e-48f8-a393-cf5df5ae523d -->

The Executive Document (also referred to as the "Executive Copy," "executive," "Executive Proposal," or "exec doc") is a formal, plain-English Markdown document that serves as the primary communication tool for presenting the contents of an Executive Vote to the community. Created after the Executive Sheet is finalized, it provides a detailed breakdown of the actions proposed in the Executive Vote. Unlike the Executive Sheet, which organizes actions in a cell-based format, the Executive Document expresses these actions in sentence format for improved readability.

Each Executive Document corresponds to a specific spell and describes the actions that the spell will perform if executed. It is a critical tool for ensuring transparency, clarity, and alignment among stakeholders. The document serves as a proposal that can be voted on and either approved or rejected by Sky Governance. The Core Facilitators are responsible for producing and finalizing the Executive Document; and any changes must be made by them.

The Executive Document is designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical members of the Sky Ecosystem. It enables Aligned Delegates and SKY holders to understand the actions that will be executed when the spell is cast. Its contents are publicly visible on the Voting Portal, where Aligned Delegates review it before voting on the spell. In addition to serving as a reference for voters, the Executive Document also guides the Spell Team in developing and finalizing the Spell, ensuring that the proposed actions are accurately implemented. The contents of the Executive Document are hashed and included within the Spell code to provide an additional layer of verification.

##### A.1.9.2.1.4 - Executive Vote [Core]  <!-- UUID: c0aea3f8-4ed9-4bd6-928b-f43ccc7d5ecf -->

Executive Vote refers to the voting process of approving governance proposals within Sky Governance. These votes are conducted onchain and are used to implement technical changes to the Sky Protocol. For an Executive Vote to be executed, it must accumulate more SKY token support than any other active proposal, including the current leading proposal, ensuring it reflects the highest level of community backing at the time of approval.

##### A.1.9.2.1.5 - Sky Governance Voting Portal [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0919d4bd-2050-43dc-a1b9-8cdfdf0cba54 -->

The Voting Portal is the primary user interface where Executive Votes are published and where Aligned Delegates and SKY holders review and vote on proposals. It serves as the canonical location for viewing active and past Executive Votes, associated documentation, and vote tallies. The Voting Portal can be found at [https://vote.sky.money/executive](https://vote.sky.money/executive).

##### A.1.9.2.1.6 - Custom Spell Voting Page [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7171aa68-668e-49bb-bf00-511cb79eb5e9 -->

The custom spell voting page is the public interface used to submit, review, and vote on Executive Votes that are not accompanied by a formal Executive Document. It also supports voting on pre-deployed standby spells by allowing stakeholders to specify target contract addresses and calldata directly. The custom spell voting page can be found at [https://vote.sky.money/custom-spell](https://vote.sky.money/custom-spell).

##### A.1.9.2.1.7 - Spell [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7d798e34-cdb0-4416-ab11-b5b48ccf61e6 -->

Spell is a term specific to the Sky Protocol. It refers to all technical components of an Executive Vote, encompassing the codebase, code operations, code reviews, and overall code quality. The term "spell" is often used interchangeably with the Executive Vote itself, as it represents the smart contract responsible for enacting changes to the protocol. Spells are categorized as either "regular" or "out-of-schedule." Regular spells adhere to a biweekly cadence, while out-of-schedule spells are handled with service-level agreements (SLAs) determined on a case-by-case basis.

##### A.1.9.2.1.8 - Ecosystem Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: e2bc30b0-1370-44e6-9872-39530ff61d65 -->

Ecosystem Spell Validation (also referred to as "spell validation" or "validation") refers to the process of performing a set of checks and high-level review of a specific spell’s code as it exists on the blockchain (referred to as a "deployed spell"). This process applies only to the deployed spell and is not as comprehensive as the reviews conducted during the spell development process by the Spell Reviewers. The purpose of spell validation is to validate the safety of the current spell in respect to its security impacts in relation to Sky Protocol smart contracts.

##### A.1.9.2.1.9 - Spell Roster [Core]  <!-- UUID: 34fb69c2-12db-452c-a773-1d3ed706b993 -->

Spell Roster refers to the two teams of technical contributors in the Sky Ecosystem, Sidestream and Dewiz. The Spell Team for the Executive Vote is selected from the members of the Spell Roster.

##### A.1.9.2.1.10 - Spell Team [Core]  <!-- UUID: 202874e5-65f8-4250-bfb1-5122e5656395 -->

Each Executive Vote has a dedicated Spell Team, made up of Spell Crafters and Spell Reviewers. The Spell Team must include one Crafter, who is responsible for crafting the spells. The Spell Team must also include at least two Reviewers, responsible for reviewing and confirming that the spells are ready for the Executive Vote, at least one of whom should be a member of a different Ecosystem Actor than the Spell Crafter. A Crafter cannot serve as a Reviewer for the same spell. The Spell Team is a set of technical contributors working on developing all technical and smart-contract-related aspects of a particular Executive Vote, based on instructions set out by the Governance Point.

##### A.1.9.2.1.11 - Spell Crafter [Core]  <!-- UUID: e007c08a-5fef-42df-a63b-7b4d78b3366f -->

The Spell Crafter (the Crafter) is the person or entity who parses the written instruction set of a proposed Executive to Solidity code in order to develop the spell in the first instance. Every addition, modification, or removal of code or content within the spell must be performed by the Crafter. The designated Spell Crafter must be rotated, such that the same person does not craft the spells for two consecutive Executive Votes. The Spell Crafter is a member of the Spell Team for a particular Executive Vote.

##### A.1.9.2.1.12 - Spell Reviewer [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8d7a61c4-c1fd-4fbb-bbe9-1c2d6f4f3cdd -->

The Spell Reviewers (the Reviewers) are the people or entities responsible for reviewing the draft spell as parsed by the Spell Crafter. The Reviewers are responsible for verifying the spell, finding issues and catching bugs and mistakes in the spell, and otherwise ensuring its quality. There is an important delineation between the function of Spell Crafters and Spell Reviewers: the Reviewers may not perform any addition, modification or removal of code or content within the spell, although they may suggest changes to the Spell Crafter. Spell Reviewers are members of the wider Spell Team for a particular Executive Vote.

#### A.1.9.2.2 - Roles in the Executive Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: fb57a48c-5c33-45a4-a49b-2547234129c0 -->

Several different actors within the Sky Community play a role in the Executive Process. The specific actors involved vary depending on the content of the items included in the Executive Process. These actors are categorized into four groups: Governance Point, Technical Point, Content Liaisons, and SKY holders (acting directly or via Aligned Delegates and Shadow Delegates).

##### A.1.9.2.2.1 - Governance Point And Governance Backup [Core]  <!-- UUID: b8d55094-f75e-4316-9b68-59cbb72e5b26 -->

The Governance Point is selected from the Core Facilitators. Currently, the only Core Facilitator is JanSky. Each Spell also has a designated Governance Backup. The Governance Backup is required to assume the responsibilities of the Governance Point if the original Governance Point becomes unavailable, effectively stepping into the role as needed. The Governance Point is responsible for coordinating the Executive Vote and ensuring that the information in the Executive Sheet accurately reflects the progress of the spell.

The Technical Point has domain expertise as the crafter of the smart contracts, but the Governance Point also has crucial context and should serve as a cross-check to the extent they can. The Governance Point is expected to ask questions where needed.

###### A.1.9.2.2.1.1 - Role Of Governance Point And Backup [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4137e37c-27ac-4618-8327-d88a23a7c9ce -->

The role of Governance Point and Governance Backup alternates from within the Core Facilitator. The positions rotate, following an internal schedule.

###### A.1.9.2.2.1.2 - Responsibilities For Governance Point [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6de84303-18f4-4d70-b259-b8f02c49b9bc -->

The Governance Point has the following responsibilities in the Executive process:

- Gather the proposed content for the Executive sheet and prepare a draft of the Executive Vote.

- Align on Executive Vote contents with the relevant teams, and coordinate technical details.

- Ensure the contents of each Executive Vote are justified by processes or structures ratified by Sky Governance.

- Produce the text (Executive Document) that accompanies each Executive Vote and verify that the delivered code matches the code reviewed and approved on GitHub and that it contains all expected actions from the sheet.

- Publish the Executive Vote on the official Voting Portal.

##### A.1.9.2.2.2 - Technical Point [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6474ab2e-da22-4227-9aff-7f13ac0dd471 -->

The Technical Point role is filled by the Spell Team or the Spell Crafter from that group. For each Executive Vote, a Spell Team is selected from the Spell Roster to steward the spell development process.

Within the Spell Team, the Spell Crafter serves as the primary point of contact for the Governance Point and any external parties. If the Spell Crafter is unavailable or if disagreements arise, the Governance Point’s secondary point of contact is the Spell Reviewers.

Input or opinions from external parties on technical details should be treated as informational and should not influence the spell decision-making process.

###### A.1.9.2.2.2.1 - Spell Team Configuration [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4862ed4e-097b-42fa-a197-1d407d220a77 -->

The Spell Team consists of the Crafter(s) and Reviewers for a designated spell.

Currently, Sky has two teams of technical contributors for spell development, Dewiz, and Sidestream. They rotate the responsibility of crafting and reviewing as follows:

- When Dewiz is crafting:
    ◦ Crafting: one Dewiz member
    ◦ Reviewing: one Dewiz member, one Sidestream member

- When Sidestream is crafting:
    ◦ Crafting: one Sidestream member
    ◦ Reviewing: one Sidestream member, one Dewiz member.

##### A.1.9.2.2.3 - Content Liaisons [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4ed84898-db7b-4759-bd00-e3cf09ac27e9 -->

The Content Liaisons are the stakeholders involved in a specific spell. They participate in the verification process and confirm the accuracy of items relevant to their area of expertise, to ensure accuracy of those items in the Executive Sheet. Many different actors in the Sky Ecosystem serve as Content Liaisons for Executive Votes.

##### A.1.9.2.2.4 - SKY Holders [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3e1d0486-4805-4bed-a246-f75198e111e6 -->

The SKY token is a governance token that grants the owner voting rights in the Sky Protocol. SKY holders can exercise their voting power directly by participating in governance decisions, such as Executive Votes, or they can delegate their tokens to an Aligned Delegate or a Shadow Delegate to vote on their behalf.

###### A.1.9.2.2.4.1 - Aligned Delegates [Core]  <!-- UUID: 891a72ff-bfdc-4353-b6a0-0719de4d36ac -->

Aligned Delegates are recognized representatives who vote on Sky governance decisions on behalf of their delegators. They are officially listed in the Atlas and, if they fulfill certain requirements such as operational security and engagement levels, they can receive compensation from Sky. They validate and vote on Executive Votes, and should inform the community about their validation of a Spell, along with the reasoning for their vote, through the Sky Forum.

###### A.1.9.2.2.4.2 - Shadow Delegates [Core]  <!-- UUID: c38ceb17-a35c-4f1c-a526-2267d1b424b5 -->

Shadow Delegates serve as alternative representatives for SKY holders who delegate their tokens. They are not officially recorded in the Atlas and do not receive any compensation from Sky. They may participate in governance decisions and vote on behalf of their delegators.

#### A.1.9.2.3 - Content Of The Executive Vote [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7b4c9934-5ba4-4218-b601-8f44ffb5881e -->

The content of an Executive Vote typically consists of the set of onchain changes executed by the Spell. Depending on the specific needs of Sky and the Agents, an Executive Vote may also include DAO resolutions or other off-chain decisions.

There is a set of recurring items in all Executive Votes, and some onchain changes reflect frequently occurring actions. These are set forth in more detail in the subdocuments herein.

##### A.1.9.2.3.1 - Recurring Items [Core]  <!-- UUID: d1d16776-3eec-4e7d-b591-052fe9c2c45b -->

For each Executive Vote, the parameters listed in the subdocuments herein are always specified. It is the Spell Crafter who is responsible for identifying if the proposed contents of the Spell require the parameters to be set to "Yes" or "No".

###### A.1.9.2.3.1.1 - Office Hours [Core]  <!-- UUID: 11cf1764-aefa-4343-ad44-e993024b3192 -->

Office hours are set to "Yes"  if a spell introduces major changes that can affect external parties, or if a stakeholder makes a specific request for the office-hours modifier to be switched on. Typical examples include collateral offboarding, onboarding new modules, oracle changes, and other actions that may have a significant impact on the protocol or its users.

While stakeholders can request that Office Hours be switched on, the final decision and responsibility for setting this parameter rests with the Spell Crafter. If the office hours modifier is on, the spell can only be executed between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday. The purpose of this modifier is to ensure that Ecosystem Actors are available to address any issues that may arise during or shortly after the execution of the spell. The spell will have an extra restriction on top of the GSM Pause Delay, meaning it can only be cast during that timeframe, regardless of when it was approved.

###### A.1.9.2.3.1.2 - Global Line Modifier [Core]  <!-- UUID: df0835ea-e299-4fe2-aaca-3926f09913b9 -->

The Global Line Modifier, also referred to as the Global Debt Ceiling, defines the system-wide debt ceiling for Sky. It is set to "Yes" if there is a modification to any collateral type’s line that necessitates that the global Line is also modified.

###### A.1.9.2.3.1.3 - Order Of Operations [Core]  <!-- UUID: 18b4c424-68bd-4599-b8b5-9325d0dd8f3b -->

The Order of Operations parameter is relevant when actions within a spell, or across multiple spells, must be executed in a specific order to ensure that the correct final value is set. This applies to cases where dependencies, conflicting changes, or timing-sensitive modifications require precise sequencing to achieve the intended outcome. The Order of Operations parameter is set to "Yes" when actions must be executed in a specific order.

##### A.1.9.2.3.2 - Common Items [Core]  <!-- UUID: 64edb1ca-e577-41c4-aa9e-5af759b2d240 -->

Some onchain changes frequently occur as part of the normal operations of Sky. Sometimes these common items have specialized processes associated with them. Common items for Executive Votes are listed in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.1 - Smart Contract Deployment Verification [Core]  <!-- UUID: 55e774c1-dcef-4262-bc47-c32c94c0d557 -->

For deployments of new modules such as an Allocation System Invocation or SP-BEAM, or to replace an old module, the process outlined in the subdocuments must be followed. The subdocuments provide additional detail regarding the smart contract deployment verification for each step in the Executive Process, where relevant. Unless otherwise stated, the normal process set out in [A.1.9.2.4 - Executive Process Breakdown](98298ab3-8d08-4c4f-b47b-81242a3e3903) applies.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.2.2 - Interim Deployments [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9b3edbbf-89d1-42da-a9c3-18f858f8471f -->

Prime Agents are allowed to deploy a new Allocation Instance on-chain and allocate capital through it under constrained testing conditions, prior to completing a full risk assessment. Such deployments are termed "Interim Deployments". Interim Deployments are otherwise subject to the customary requirements of the Sky Core Executive Spell and Prime Proxy Spell process.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.2.2.1 - Process Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: db6f880b-17d9-41b0-8940-5afdeda1e7f1 -->

The documents herein define the process for Interim Deployments.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.2.2.1.1 - Forum Post By Prime Agent [Core]  <!-- UUID: de77dbbc-8ff6-44c7-814c-9ee10ca7a543 -->

The technical implementation of Interim Deployments must successfully complete all required external audits before the Prime can post its Interim Deployment proposal to the Forum.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.2.2.1.2 - Specification Of Testing Parameters By Core Council Risk Advisor [Core]  <!-- UUID: a93952b9-b9c3-45eb-8169-abd0153d3df4 -->

Once posted to the Forum, the Core Council Risk Advisor must respond on the Forum thread specifying testing parameters that will govern the Interim Deployment, including maximum exposure and rate limits. The Prime must maintain 100% Instance Capital Requirement Ratio for all Interim Deployments.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.2.2.1.3 - Submission Of Artifact Edit Proposal By Governance Actor [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0c0e09e7-4cbf-4a6f-acfa-0c13c67abca1 -->

Subsequently, the appropriate Governance Actor must submit an Artifact Edit Proposal incorporating the approved testing parameters into the Prime’s Artifact.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.2.2.1.4 - Artifact Update [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1fc1ba29-9273-4d95-b1a5-bdfc61ebf2ab -->

Upon successful conclusion of the Artifact Edit Poll, the Prime's Agent Artifact is updated with a new Instance Configuration Document codifying the Deployment’s approved interim testing parameters and other basic data.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.2.2.1.5 - Inclusion Of Interim Deployment In Sky Core Executive Cycle [Core]  <!-- UUID: fe8e5e31-fc3a-4631-894c-890cb6c82d81 -->

The approved Artifact Edit Poll and resulting Instance Configuration Document serve as provenance authorizing the inclusion of the Interim Deployment into the Sky Core Executive Cycle.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.2.2.1.6 - Creation Of Public Information Dashboard [Core]  <!-- UUID: 14954d6a-0b97-45bf-8734-1e50af8f9ca7 -->

The Prime Agent must create a publicly available information dashboard through a platform such as Dune showing, at a minimum, the current exposure to the Interim Deployment. This requirement is waived if the Core Council Risk Advisor has already included the Interim Deployment in the publicly available information dashboard at https://info.sky.money.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.2.2.1.7 - Prime Agent Usage Of Interim Deployment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 02cb6865-6e41-4465-a1b2-bbeededd9258 -->

Once the Interim Deployment has been deployed and all requirements above have been satisfied, the Prime Agent may begin using it subject to the approved testing parameters.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.2.2.1.8 - Completion Of Full Risk Assessment [Core]  <!-- UUID: b405eadc-2538-44fc-9b7a-31d45ab601c7 -->

Following the Interim Deployment, the Prime will work with the Core Council Risk Advisor to complete a full risk assessment. Once the means to calculate an official Capital Requirement Ratio for the deployment has been determined, the Prime can request that Core GovOps propose a subsequent Atlas Edit Proposal to lift the testing constraints and reduce the RRC to the Atlas-calculated value.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3 - Execution Of Agent Spells [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5b0fd894-094e-4b0c-91ca-c5b59b710c0c -->

The execution of Agent Spells is described in the subdocuments herein. Two methods are available: direct execution in a Sky Core Spell and execution through StarGuard. Execution through StarGuard is the preferred method and any exceptions require valid reasoning.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.1 - Execution Through StarGuard [Core]  <!-- UUID: 78ec918d-cd9e-4326-bfa9-ab338e658a8b -->

When the execution through the StarGuard method is used, the Agent Spells are whitelisted in Sky Core Spells and later executed using the StarGuard module. The Sky Core Spell includes a whitelist of approved Agent Spells, which allows them to be executed via separate transactions. This enhances resilience and scalability, ensuring robust handling of payloads from multiple active Agents while minimizing risks to Sky Core.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.1.1 - StarGuard [Core]  <!-- UUID: e5cbb61a-82c3-4fce-b6f2-191911d5c155 -->

For each Agent, a `StarGuard` contract is deployed to manage whitelisting and execution of Agent Spells. This contract acts as a standardized "proxy wrapper".

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.1.1.1 - StarGuard Deployment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3123f615-d7a0-41a9-9285-e698cae6ee9a -->

For each new SubProxy, the StarGuard contract should be deployed and initialized in the same Spell and added to the keeper job, StarGuardJob.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.1.1.2 - StarGuard Functionality [Core]  <!-- UUID: 04712596-beda-452e-a667-44e6fe707abd -->

When initiated in a Sky Core Spell, the StarGuard whitelists relevant Agent Spells, enabling their secure execution. This whitelisting allows Agent Spells to run independently, supporting arbitrary complexity and custom features like office hours or expiration times. StarGuard also supports dropping a whitelisted Agent Spell, providing a mechanism to revoke access if needed for security or error correction. This is done via the `drop()` function.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.1.1.2.1 - StarGuard Ownership [Core]  <!-- UUID: e6ec35bc-28af-4e06-bc92-c8706add6017 -->

The StarGuard contract is owned by the Pause Proxy, ensuring centralized control and preventing unauthorized changes.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.1.1.2.2 - Responsibilities For Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3deb3282-434c-4d56-b5e3-3a4daad3cd1d -->

The Agents are required to include logic for the public view method `isExecutable()` in their Spell. This function is used to signal if the Spell is ready to be executed in a particular block or not. StarGuard cannot execute an Agent Spell if `isExecutable()` returns `False`. The value that must be returned for execution to be possible is `True`.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.1.1.2.3 - StarGuard Whitelisting Authority [Core]  <!-- UUID: f23f9ea7-64e1-4083-93b8-2864b232f451 -->

Only the owner, the Pause Proxy, is able to whitelist new Agent Spells via a Sky Core Spell.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.1.1.2.4 - StarGuard Max Delay [Core]  <!-- UUID: ccb1f61a-660b-4a8a-976f-53915dd21b03 -->

A configurable `maxDelay` sets the maximum duration between the whitelisting of the Agent Spell in the Sky Core Spell and the execution of the Agent Spell. This feature ensures Spells do not linger indefinitely, enforcing timely processing and reducing risks from delayed or forgotten actions. The recommended value for `maxDelay` is seven (7) days.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.1.1.2.5 - Requirements For Whitelisting [Core]  <!-- UUID: a03c9e5a-4fe4-46a2-8ec6-f8900ed90f47 -->

The requirements for whitelisting are:

- The address of the Agent Spell.
- The codehash of the Spell's bytecode.
- Confirmation that direct execution is not needed. If direct execution is needed, a valid reason must be provided.

This information must be provided by the Agent Spell reviewers to the Governance Point.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.1.1.2.6 - Permissionless Execution [Core]  <!-- UUID: 50f71e34-6705-4ccb-a911-3797b05f422f -->

The triggering of an Agent Spell is permissionless; anyone can initiate execution. A keeper job, StarGuardJob, allows keepers to monitor and execute eligible Spells at the earliest possible block.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.1.1.2.7 - Function Call For Execution [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8113159f-dcf6-4c44-afb0-aed09b1e5cf7 -->

Execution is initiated on the StarGuard contract via its `exec()` function, which performs necessary validation checks before calling the SubProxy’s `exec(spellDataCopy.addr, abi.encodePacked(StarSpellLike.execute.selector))` to perform the Spell's actions.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.1.1.2.7.1 - Validation Checks By StarGuard [Core]  <!-- UUID: e15ea323-038d-4935-a39e-295c152251da -->

The following checks are enabled by the contract:

- Verifies that the whitelisted Spell is executable only once, enforcing single-use to prevent replay attacks or unauthorized repeats.
- Verifies that the whitelisted bytecode codehash is valid, protecting against tampering or malicious alterations.
- Verifies that the Spell meets custom requirements (e.g., office hours) by confirming the `spell.isExecutable()` view function returns true.
- Verifies that StarGuard retains access to the SubProxy, ensuring no loss of control during the Agent Spell execution.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.2 - Direct Execution Through Sky Core Spell [Core]  <!-- UUID: ffc88a5e-b7b2-4ed9-8c88-fcbcb7632f14 -->

When the execution through the Sky Core Spell method is used, the Agent Spells are executed directly in the Sky Core Spells.

###### A.1.9.2.3.2.3.2.1 - Sky Core Spell Executes Agent Spell [Core]  <!-- UUID: a109ad0d-0743-4ae9-bcc1-df04a6e5da43 -->

Execution of an Agent Spell is initiated by the Sky Core Spell, which directly calls `exec()` on the Agent's SubProxy contract to perform the Spell’s actions in the same transaction. The SubProxy limits rights to the specific Agent, preventing access to Sky Core contracts. The current SubProxy contract is designed to execute the Agent Spell in the same transaction as the Sky Core Spell.

#### A.1.9.2.4 - Executive Process Breakdown [Core]  <!-- UUID: 98298ab3-8d08-4c4f-b47b-81242a3e3903 -->

The Executive Process for Sky Core consists of 13 steps as outlined in the subdocuments herein. The deadlines for internal coordination between the Governance Point, Technical Point, and Content Liaisons are designed to optimize efficiency. While these timelines should generally be adhered to, they do not take precedence over security considerations. Any delays must be communicated promptly, along with updated and realistic time estimates.

##### A.1.9.2.4.1 - Governance Point Determines Preliminary Content For Executive Sheet (Step 1) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0f0f7021-f753-4c8b-8b80-46abce259aa9 -->

The Governance Point prepares the Executive Sheet by identifying items for potential inclusion. At this stage, all content and values are considered provisional. While the Governance Point prepares this preliminary plan for the content of the spell, the final consensus regarding what to include is reached during the GovOps meeting with the Spell Team. The subdocuments herein explain how the Governance Point identifies these items. This preparatory phase ensures that content is outlined and organized in advance.

###### A.1.9.2.4.1.1 - Consideration For Determining Preliminary Content For Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2c99fa29-4f22-4f40-9284-ac0c07a6cd6e -->

The process of determining which content to include in the Executive Sheet, as well as the timing of its inclusion, varies based on the nature of the items in question. Several factors must be carefully considered, including adherence to governance processes, addressing security concerns, and evaluating the urgency of the Sky Protocol. Every item included in the spell poses a security risk to Sky.

###### A.1.9.2.4.1.2 - Sources For Determining Preliminary Content For Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: 35d0ed69-3ec4-4ead-8e41-b1b9a9b5538d -->

The Governance Point must review the sources described in the subdocuments herein for potential items to include in the Executive Sheet.

###### A.1.9.2.4.1.2.1 - Governance Point Reviews And Assesses Content In The Executive Vote Queue [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4aa6a4d5-390d-47a9-af9e-b20a993741e0 -->

The Governance Point must review the Executive Vote queue, which contains items that were included in the previous cycle(s) but removed from the Executive Sheet. The Governance Point then determines which of these items should be included in the current cycle’s Executive Sheet.

###### A.1.9.2.4.1.2.2 - Items From Approved Governance Polls Or Authorized Ecosystem Actor Requests [Core]  <!-- UUID: 465c6f95-8ac0-4405-9443-bcf1e233aa82 -->

For certain changes to the Sky Protocol, the Atlas may require items to first undergo formal governance steps, such as Forum announcements or Governance Polls, before they can be included in the Executive Sheet. The Governance Point is responsible for reviewing Governance Polls and any recent Forum posts and including potential items in the Executive Sheet.

###### A.1.9.2.4.1.2.3 - Potential Items From Ecosystem Actors [Core]  <!-- UUID: ea70f102-5e35-42a7-8658-9e8053acef39 -->

The Governance Point maintains ongoing communication with Ecosystem Actors to plan and prioritize items for inclusion in the Executive Sheet. This ensures that the most critical and time-sensitive items are prioritized.

###### A.1.9.2.4.1.3 - Planning Checklist For Governance Point [Core]  <!-- UUID: dc610140-5660-4743-a9f7-4a1032c83dd5 -->

The checklist found at [https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-creation.md](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-creation.md) outlines the steps for the Governance Point in planning the Executive Sheet.

##### A.1.9.2.4.2 - Governance Point Creates Executive Sheet Week 1 Monday (Step 2) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 298819fe-cc26-49a8-a7cb-3ff83e55f291 -->

For every Executive Vote, a new Executive Sheet must be created. The process follows a standardized approach to ensure consistency across all Executive Votes. The Governance Point is responsible for the creation and maintenance of the Executive Sheet.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.1 - Structure Of The Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: bf3a5524-52cd-463b-8058-b65ca8b2c94c -->

While the content of the Executive Sheet will vary depending on the actions Sky Governance wishes to execute for the Sky Protocol, the structure of the Executive Sheet and the method of communicating the different executive actions described in the subdocuments must be adhered to.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.1.1 - Executive Action [Core]  <!-- UUID: d41c2e6a-2afc-458c-ab90-3ce863495095 -->

Every action that should be included in the spell must be present in the Executive Sheet. Each executive action is populated in the Executive Sheet under a column and broken down into "input" actions and "derived" actions. An Input Action represents a high-level category, and a Derived Action breaks down the Input Action into specific, actionable steps or changes. Each action in the Executive Sheet, whether input or derived, must have sufficient provenance to support its presence during the spell.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.1.2 - Formatting Rules For The Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: a935cfad-6674-4e77-b3f4-e605c076417e -->

The Executive Sheet should be formatted as follows:

- One single row of empty cells should be present directly above every "input" action in the Executive Sheet.

- Each "input" action must be written in bold and must be present before any actions that are derived from the ‘input’ action. Optionally, ‘input’ actions may also use underlined text.

- Actions that are "derived" from an "input" action must not use bold or underlined text and must be located directly after the "input" action.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.1.3 - Language Consistency In The Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: 199931bd-0e55-4796-b3f7-f6926c3b119a -->

The text for both "input" and "derived" actions listed in the Executive Sheet should follow previous wording and structural patterns. There should be no deviation from existing patterns of wording or sentence structure used in the Executive Sheet unless it is absolutely required for the spell process to be completed. The instructions should be specific and follow previous instructions in the archive.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.1.3.1 - Values In The Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: f6f1efeb-9f99-407e-a53a-43468c66afc4 -->

Values should be expressed as a specific number and then specify the start and end times over which this value occurs. In general, expressing values as "per day" or any other measurement per unit of time should be avoided to maintain clarity and specificity. However, certain values may require a "per unit of time" definition when it's essential for the calculation.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.1.3.2 - Expressing Relative And Absolute Changes [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3583410e-3504-4a85-98a0-90619848129c -->

Relative and absolute value increases or decreases should be stated as "Increase SSR by 3.00 percentage points from 15.50% to 18.50%".

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.1.3.3 - Express The Value Of Numbers Numerically [Core]  <!-- UUID: e60557ed-593f-4946-96f6-efcf7a853544 -->

Every number in the Executive Sheet should be expressed with a number instead of being spelled out. For example, if a value is zero the number "0" should be used instead of the word "zero". This maintains the consistency between values and thus reduces the chances of a misread or misinterpreted value.

When expressing rates or percentages, the appropriate unit should always be included (e.g., "0%" for a zero percent rate).

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.1.3.4 - Checksummed Addresses [Core]  <!-- UUID: 33ac6653-d963-4ac5-9ff5-c77c5633a9a7 -->

All blockchain addresses listed in the Executive Sheet must be checksummed to ensure accuracy and prevent errors. The addresses follow the EIP-55 standard, using mixed-case letters to create a verifiable format that helps detect typos or mismatches.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.2 - Creation Of The Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: 755fe505-8058-4f0a-bccf-eafbdcfb4f9b -->

The creation process of the Executive Sheet must follow the steps specified in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.2.1 - The Governance Point Creates The Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: ec06d92c-5836-4df9-9680-5977e5a64a72 -->

The Governance Point creates the Executive Sheet by duplicating the template tab to create a new tab within the same Google Sheet. The Executive Sheet template can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_z5WpqxzwreCcaveB2Ye1PP5B8QAHDglzyxKHG3CHw/edit?pli=1&gid=1971670262#gid=1971670262](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_z5WpqxzwreCcaveB2Ye1PP5B8QAHDglzyxKHG3CHw/edit?pli=1&gid=1971670262#gid=1971670262).

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.2.2 - The Governance Point Names The Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: e34b72db-973c-4cfd-8e8c-ff424c081805 -->

For scheduled Executive Votes in the Executive Process, the Executive Sheet must be named in the following format: "Executive Contents - YYYY-MM-DD" (Target Date). For Out-of-Schedule Executive Votes, the naming format can diverge from this standard to reflect the specific context or purpose of the vote.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.2.3 - The Governance Point Includes The Executive Vote In The Spell Progress Tracker [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1dac0bce-7edc-45a1-97f8-f11fc381015d -->

In the Google Sheet document, there is a tab named "spell progress tracking". The Governance Point must:

1. Add a new column for the Executive Vote. The column should be added to the right in the document to make sure that the Executive Votes are sorted in chronological order.

2. Enter the Target Date.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.2.4 - The Governance Point Maintains the Spell Progress Tracker [Core]  <!-- UUID: a6bab26a-a334-4d44-a45a-cf848ed36480 -->

The Governance Point must ensure that the progress for the spell is updated accurately in the spell progress tracker. When a step is completed, the Governance Point must write "done" in the spell progress tracker column. This is an ongoing responsibility throughout the lifecycle of the Executive Vote to maintain real-time accuracy.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.3 - Governance Point Populates The Executive Sheet In Consultation With Ecosystem Actors [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7a40558a-3eb4-4199-9fe5-6f5b3561c702 -->

After the formal creation of the Executive Sheet, the Governance Point populates it with items in coordination with relevant Ecosystem Actors and contributors.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.3.1 - Governance Point Includes Items In The Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9e96fca0-6a7c-4c6d-81f8-052d24d32a48 -->

The Governance Point lists the preliminary items determined for inclusion in the Executive Sheet. The Governance Point must complete information for the Input Action(s), Derived Action(s), and Type, and populate the "Liaison Confirm," "Technical Confirm," and "Governance Confirm" fields as Unconfirmed. If URLs for the Reasoning and URL Authority can be completed at this stage, the Governance Point should populate these fields.

The Governance Point will mark any items as "TBD" or "TBC" if they require further discussion or confirmation by the Technical Point or Content Liaisons.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.3.2 - Governance Point Includes Recurring Items In The Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: 37d03695-8ccb-40a9-84e9-a9871dd6caf3 -->

In every Executive Vote there are recurring items that must always be included. These are Office Hours, Global Line Modifier, and Order of Operations Issues. The values of these items can be marked with a question mark or "TBC". During the GovOps meeting the Spell Crafter will confirm the values of these items.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.3.3 - Governance Point Communicates Deadlines To Ecosystem Actors [Core]  <!-- UUID: ea9e4dd4-8148-4755-bd39-fd44b1de49b3 -->

The Governance Point is responsible for making sure that the relevant ecosystem actors included in the Executive Process are aware of the deadlines associated with the process. This includes informing them of when the Executive Sheet must be finalized and when final rates must be announced.

###### A.1.9.2.4.2.3.4 - Coordination Checklist For Governance Point [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9d1900e4-49bf-41f1-af94-20b0c770f845 -->

The checklist found at [https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-creation.md](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-creation.md) outlines the steps for the Governance Point when preparing the Executive Sheet.

##### A.1.9.2.4.3 - Governance Point Conducts GovOps Meeting Week 1 Tuesday (Step 3) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0f74afdf-bc2d-4512-9b11-8f5a26511787 -->

On Tuesday week 1, key actors involved in the Executive Process have a gov-ops meeting to discuss the upcoming Executive Vote.

###### A.1.9.2.4.3.1 - GovOps Meeting [Core]  <!-- UUID: b0d1a683-3b92-4283-8e32-22251192a716 -->

The meeting, which is conducted by text, takes place on Discord in the #govops channel, 9 days before the Target Date. The Governance Point invites and leads the meeting. The Governance Point must make sure that the items specified in the subdocuments herein are processed at the meeting. The meeting takes place at 15.00 UTC. The Governance Point creates a separate thread in the #govops channel for every Executive Vote. The thread is named the target spell date: "YYYY-MM-DD Executive Coordination".

The GovOps meeting includes various stakeholders. Governance Point, Technical Point, and Content Liaisons typically attend, whether sync or async.

The Executive Sheet serves as the basic reference for stakeholders. The decisions made by stakeholders will often result in real-time changes to the Executive Sheet.

###### A.1.9.2.4.3.1.1 - Confirmation Of Roles [Core]  <!-- UUID: d8e11fe9-dec8-4a71-9519-8aede2213167 -->

During the GovOps meeting the Governance Point will ask for confirmation of who will act as Crafter and Reviewers for the Executive Vote. The technical teams provide names for the roles.

###### A.1.9.2.4.3.1.2 - Content Review [Core]  <!-- UUID: 25bbdd08-4823-449b-bc95-944450336286 -->

The Governance Point lists the preliminary content in the Executive Sheet. Each item is discussed at the meeting. The review during the GovOps meeting primarily focuses on the technical aspects of the instructions in the Executive Sheet. The Technical Point often provides technical advice to the Governance Point during the GovOps meetings, including technical risk and other implications that the Governance Point may not otherwise be aware of. If the spell includes complex code, the Technical Point may sometimes prepare technical documents to facilitate the process.

The Governance Point may have additional discussions with Ecosystem Actors in separate Discord channels.

###### A.1.9.2.4.3.1.3 - Obtain Consensus On Content [Core]  <!-- UUID: bba8d328-8210-428b-95ae-f690936c6016 -->

Based on the review of requested and planned content, the teams must reach a consensus on which items to include in the spell. In some cases, the Spell Crafter may request the removal of certain items if the spell is deemed high risk, too big or contains novel code. Such removals typically affect non-critical items, such as internal payments. Content being removed from the Executive Sheet is added to the Executive Vote queue to be included in the next Executive Vote cycle.

Onboarding of sensitive modules is considered increasing the spell's complexity in such a manner that the Spell Reviewers should only focus on this; therefore, non-crucial items should be removed from the Executive Sheet and included in the Executive Vote queue.

###### A.1.9.2.4.3.1.4 - Confirming Values Of Recurring Items [Core]  <!-- UUID: d79509f0-089e-46ee-ada8-bb1a66e99482 -->

Based on the planned content of the spell, the Governance Point must ask the Technical Point to confirm the values of the recurring checklist items. See [A.1.9.2.4.2.3.2 - Governance Point Includes Recurring Items In The Executive Sheet](37d03695-8ccb-40a9-84e9-a9871dd6caf3).

###### A.1.9.2.4.3.1.5 - GovOps Meeting Checklist [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6361b7c7-8cb3-49bf-83a8-a3684623d37e -->

The checklist found at [https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-creation.md](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-creation.md) outlines the discussion points for the GovOps meeting.

###### A.1.9.2.4.3.2 - Post Meeting Tasks [Core]  <!-- UUID: c38da8ab-1fdd-42e9-8b96-366a51a26e85 -->

After the GovOps meeting, the Governance Point must do the items specified in the subdocuments herein. The items should be completed week 1 Tuesday.

###### A.1.9.2.4.3.2.1 - Specify Roles And Recurring Items In Executive Sheet [Core]  <!-- UUID: a51689a8-dd58-4cd6-9490-da2bf4148d64 -->

The values of the recurring items, as determined during the GovOps meeting, must be added to the Executive Sheet. Additionally, the roles for the Spell Crafter, Spell Reviewers, and Content Liaisons must be recorded in the sheet. The identity of the Content Liaison is determined as the party that originally requested the item for inclusion.

###### A.1.9.2.4.3.2.2 - Update The Executive Sheet Content [Core]  <!-- UUID: 28fea6ae-c0f8-47a9-be72-7d4ab2c58272 -->

Items that reached a consensus during the GovOps meeting must be reflected in the Executive Sheet. This includes both the removal of existing items and the addition of new items, as confirmed by all parties during the GovOps meeting.

###### A.1.9.2.4.3.2.3 - Checksums [Core]  <!-- UUID: b97f9d90-82cd-4ca8-a78f-a7e9c115a4f5 -->

The total amount of token transfers must always be summed up in the Executive Sheet. The Governance Point and Technical Point independently sum up the value. The value of USDS and Dai must always be expressed as integers, with no decimal places, due to tests and helper functions used by developers requiring integer values. For USDS and Dai, values must always be rounded up to ensure recipients receive at least the expected amount. The values of SKY and other tokens must be listed to exactly two decimal places. All summations must occur only after the Executive Sheet is complete to avoid missing any transfers.

###### A.1.9.2.4.3.2.4 - Post-meeting Checklist [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3f90dcbd-8a43-44ce-9c2a-c6efdabcbba7 -->

The checklist found at [https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-creation.md](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-creation.md) outlines the steps for the post-meeting tasks.

##### A.1.9.2.4.4 - Governance Point Requests Confirmation Of Executive Sheet Week 1 Wednesday (Step 4) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3bf7e2f3-a5e4-4bb6-ace7-3b8102a2cab7 -->

The Governance Point must request confirmations from the relevant stakeholders for each item in the Executive Sheet on Wednesday week 1.

###### A.1.9.2.4.4.1 - Governance Point Must Coordinate With Stakeholders [Core]  <!-- UUID: 17f172c6-2469-4447-8c36-3aff93a6b10b -->

The Governance Point is responsible for coordinating with all relevant stakeholders and clarifying which items should be confirmed by the different stakeholders.

###### A.1.9.2.4.4.2 - Governance Point Must Correct Discrepancies [Core]  <!-- UUID: 89d800a0-edba-4905-b38c-815f6a45949b -->

The Governance Point must ensure that any discrepancies between the Executive Sheet and stakeholder input are corrected.

The stakeholders communicate in the #govops channel in Discord if there are any issues or required changes that need to be made in the Executive Sheet. The Governance Point then changes the instruction in accordance with the stakeholder's input, and asks the stakeholder to confirm that the new instruction is correct. This is common for technical instructions in the Executive Sheet.

###### A.1.9.2.4.4.3 - Summary Checklist [Core]  <!-- UUID: 835d1f82-b0ee-40d3-8e7b-41f47d25e6b7 -->

The checklist found at [https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-creation.md](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-creation.md) outlines the items for the confirmation process that should be done.

##### A.1.9.2.4.5 - Confirmation Of Content Of Executive Sheet Week 1 Friday (Step 5) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 558451e8-1b04-48ce-bcb2-9c69ba22929b -->

On Friday week 1, the Governance Point, Technical Point and Content Liaisons must confirm the items in the Executive Sheet.

###### A.1.9.2.4.5.1 - Provenance [Core]  <!-- UUID: c86c3a65-e601-465d-9961-9f38dcd4c35a -->

All actions in the Executive Sheet require sufficient provenance for their inclusion in the sheet and later in the Executive Vote. The legitimacy of a provenance is assessed on the basis of its mutability, visibility and resistance to compromise by external malicious actors. There are different ways of providing sufficient provenance, including "strong comment type" provenance, "onchain" provenance and "strong document type" provenance. These types of provenance are defined in the subdocuments herein.

If Executive actions and items do not have sufficient provenance, for example, "weak comment type", they cannot be included in the Executive Vote. If the Governance Point has any question whether a proposed Executive action has sufficient provenance, they must resolve that question of validity before including that action in the Executive Process.

###### A.1.9.2.4.5.1.1 - Weak Comment Type Provenance [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4140df92-a505-46e0-a399-2c8d3ece9284 -->

The provenance type "weak comment type provenance" refers to informal or editable comments made by stakeholders, which lack the security and visibility needed for Executive actions. For example, Discord messages, forum posts, or unverified social media comments are considered weak comment provenance, even if they relate to an action affecting the commenter (e.g., confirming a payment). Weak comment types are highly mutable, as they can often be edited or deleted without a public trace, and may not be visible to all ecosystem participants (e.g., requiring platform-specific accounts or access to private channels). They also have low resistance to compromise, relying on accounts without strong security protocols, making them vulnerable to malicious edits or takeovers by bad actors. As such, weak comment provenance does not qualify as sufficient and must not be used to authorize Executive actions.

###### A.1.9.2.4.5.1.2 - Strong Comment Type Provenance [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8e18add4-2ac0-4ee8-b42f-5187bfccc212 -->

The provenance type "strong comment type provenance" refers to comments made by stakeholders that relate to a specific executive action. For example, Google Sheets confirmation comments left by payment recipients and GitHub pull request comments left by Agent representatives are considered strong comment provenance if the comment relates to an action that affects them (i.e. where they are a stakeholder receiving a payment in the Executive). Strong comment provenance types are considered easy to modify by the commenting party, hence why they possess lower legitimacy than document provenance types. While these comments may store a record of the fact that they were edited, the edit history is not always publicly visible and therefore they are considered to possess high mutability.

###### A.1.9.2.4.5.1.3 - OnChain Provenance [Core]  <!-- UUID: d6c5909e-031c-43d9-984c-09e48985a1a1 -->

The provenance type "onchain provenance" is one of the most legitimate types of provenance. Onchain information refers to information obtained from Sky Protocol-associated smart contracts and is considered practically immutable and publicly visible. Due to the design of these decentralized storage providers such as IPFS, information referred to by on-chain values or content hashes but stored on IPFS or other similar services is also considered practically immutable. The compromise resistance of on-chain values is very strong and relies on a compromised controller of a Sky Protocol-associated smart contract or severe supply chain attack to manipulate information.

###### A.1.9.2.4.5.1.4 - Strong Document Type Provenance [Core]  <!-- UUID: ea9dd463-9330-4a61-8958-4e2083a93101 -->

The provenance type "strong document type provenance" refers to actions approved by Sky Governance either directly (as through a Governance Poll) or through the inherent authority of the Sky Atlas. Examples of strong document type provenance are very hard to modify, as they cannot be modified or changed without a subsequent vote. They are always public in nature, as they are either required to be voted on or refer to the Sky Atlas which is publicly accessible. There is practically no account compromise risk with this category of provenance as all changes go through a vote and review process. Accordingly, strong document type provenance is considered one of the most legitimate types of provenance.

###### A.1.9.2.4.5.1.5 - Provenance URLs [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9f3b48a1-2b3e-41f0-b352-2c39aec28118 -->

The Governance Point can leave comments in the designated columns "Reasoning URL" and "Authority URL". These comments typically provide instances of the ‘strong comment type’ of provenance and therefore authorize the execution of executive actions using the authority provided to the commenting party by the Atlas. The provenance URLs always correspond to comments in the spell code.

###### A.1.9.2.4.5.2 - Confirmation By Technical Point [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4c37fa46-1853-4bf2-a9fa-edae67da0fa2 -->

The Executive Sheet includes a column titled "Technical Confirm." Items requiring confirmation by the Technical Point must be marked as "Confirmed" by the end of the day (UTC) Friday week 1.

###### A.1.9.2.4.5.3 - Confirmation By Content Liaisons [Core]  <!-- UUID: 26133c1d-29da-42de-b9a2-00f4e13699f2 -->

The Executive Sheet includes a column titled "Liaison Confirm." Items requiring confirmation by the Content Liaisons must be marked as "Confirmed" by the end of the day (UTC) week 1 Friday. The Executive Sheet can name several different Content Liaisons, and the confirmation should only be done for the items the different Content Liaisons are responsible for.

The Content Liaisons do not have access to edit the Executive Sheet, and therefore leave a comment in the document at the appropriate cell to provide confirmation. After the Content Liaisons confirm their items by leaving a comment, the Governance Point edits the Executive Sheet from "Unconfirmed" to "Confirmed". The comments are only made for cells of the type "Derived".

Items requiring confirmation include, for example, addresses, token amounts, parameter values, etc.

###### A.1.9.2.4.5.4 - Confirmation By Governance [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5370113e-97ef-438a-ad16-69caad421fe4 -->

The Executive Sheet includes a column titled "Governance Confirm." Items requiring confirmation by Governance must be marked as "Confirmed" by the end of the day (UTC) week 1 Friday.

###### A.1.9.2.4.5.5 - Summary Checklist [Core]  <!-- UUID: ddf293ed-a846-480c-99ab-cb429a789c93 -->

The checklist found at [https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-creation.md](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-creation.md) outlines the items for the confirmation process that should be done.

##### A.1.9.2.4.6 - Governance Point Finalizes Executive Sheet Week 1 Friday (Step 6) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9f291bda-cace-4787-b31b-24b8b42bdd27 -->

On Friday week 1, the Governance Point must make sure that the Executive Sheet is finalized and ready for handover to the Spell Team. This includes verifying that all required fields are completed, the content aligns with decisions made during the GovOps meeting, and all financial details are accurate. The Governance Point must notify the Spell Team in the #govops channel that the Executive Sheet is finalized. Any updates to the Executive Sheet made after Friday, week 1, must follow the procedure in [A.1.9.2.4.8.3.8 - Core Facilitator Must Notify Spell Team Of Changes](e3d137d7-3244-497b-b065-25cc2dffafeb).

###### A.1.9.2.4.6.1 - Governance Point Must Ensure The Executive Sheet Is Completed [Core]  <!-- UUID: ed4254b8-983d-4cf9-acc1-0bb9130ec2e2 -->

The Governance Point is responsible for ensuring that the Executive Sheet is fully completed and accurate. This includes the following:

- That all fields in the Executive Sheet are filled in with the required information, including URLs, figures, and confirmations. For any incomplete items (e.g., awaiting final figures), they must be marked with a `TODO` tag.

- That all items included in the Executive Sheet were discussed and approved during the GovOps meeting.
    ◦ No approved items from the discussions can be omitted without a valid reason.

- That the financial transfers are accurate.
    ◦ USDS transfers must be rounded up to the nearest whole number (no decimal points).
    ◦ SKY transfers must be listed to exactly two decimal places.
    ◦ Verify that the checksum for USDS and SKY transfers is accurate.

- The spell items must be listed in order of importance for an average SKY voter except when there are order of operations concerns.

###### A.1.9.2.4.6.2 - Summary Checklist [Core]  <!-- UUID: d246530d-693c-4b1f-b139-2c3fef8b1de0 -->

The checklist found at [https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-review.md](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes/blob/main/processes/spell-sheet-review.md) outlines the items for the finalization process that should be done.

##### A.1.9.2.4.7 - Spell Crafter Crafts Spell Week 2 Monday (Step 7) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 60aac647-4fa3-4c1c-b9d4-8ababf001958 -->

The Spell Crafter must ensure that the spell is crafted and completed on Monday week 2.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.1 - Spell Crafting Workflow [Core]  <!-- UUID: 510651ca-5a9a-4ac1-ba69-f3c160e185d2 -->

In the Development Stage, the Spell Crafter writes the code for the spell based on the contents of the Executive Sheet. The output of the Development Process is a Pull Request containing the code for the Spell that is ready for review. In performing the Development Stage, the Crafter takes the steps set forth in the checklists found here: [https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/pe-checklists/blob/master/spell/spell-crafter-mainnet-workflow.md](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/pe-checklists/blob/master/spell/spell-crafter-mainnet-workflow.md).

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.2 - Spell Crafting Rules [Core]  <!-- UUID: c714f3b3-d11a-4089-89a5-0183937cb8dc -->

The Crafter must comply with a number of rules when carrying out their role and responsibilities in spell development. These rules are generally aimed at maximizing the safety and security of the spell and are set out in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.2.1 - Previous Spell Code Cleanup [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3889281f-3306-4701-b1a3-5e0707bb7ef8 -->

Before developing the current spell, the designated Crafter must clean up the previous spell code. Code cleanup includes the `DssSpell.sol` (spell code), `DssSpell.t.sol` (spell code tests) and `config.sol `(deployed spell information) files. In this process of code cleanup, the Crafter must remove unused interfaces as well as spell code and test code from the last spell. If relevant, they must also clean up any dependency files from the previous spell that are not being used for the current spell.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.2.2 - The Executive Sheet Serves As Source Of Truth [Core]  <!-- UUID: cff7d85c-2bbb-4f93-afa8-0bcfabcb838d -->

The Crafter must use the Executive Sheet as their key reference document and source of truth while developing the spell. While the Executive Document is the instruction document for the Executive Process, the Executive Sheet is available earlier which enables the Crafter to begin spell development at an earlier stage.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.2.3 - The Crafter Is The Only Party Permitted To Approve GitHub Suggestions [Core]  <!-- UUID: 816601b0-2fdf-4c6d-9c63-a5ef5d4bebbd -->

The designated Crafter is the only person or entity permitted to commit GitHub code suggestions to the spell. The Crafter can only commit suggestions that have been made by a designated Reviewer for the particular spell. However, using GitHub suggestions is generally discouraged while developing the spell.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.2.4 - Crafter Master Branch Safety Check [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1a0d9151-df9c-403d-a38c-b7d0afc1f8a9 -->

In order to ensure that no malicious maintenance pull requests have been merged, the Crafter must check that the latest commit made to the "master" (or "main") branch of the spell repository is the commit that merged the last spell to master.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.2.5 - Tests Must Pass Before Crafter Provides Spell to Reviewers [Core]  <!-- UUID: 12c126be-0535-4147-a17e-91f670ad8339 -->

Before marking a spell’s Pull Request as "ready for review", the Crafter must ensure that both continuous integration tests and locally run tests are all passing successfully. The only exception to this rule is when the continuous integration tests are broken at no fault of the Spell Team - due to a GitHub failure or otherwise - in which case the spell can be marked as "ready for review" if locally run tests are passing. The Crafter must not remove or disable failing tests in order to bypass this rule.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.3 - Process For Handling Technical Issues [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2c8e81bf-b79a-486f-80eb-bd9b15464695 -->

The Crafter plays a key role in the process for identifying, analyzing, and resolving technical issues like bugs, mistakes, and exploits when they arise during the spell development process. Other stakeholders, including the Spell Reviewer and Core Facilitators, also play an important role. This process is set out in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.3.1 - Issue Detection and Classification [Core]  <!-- UUID: 38a261c4-de67-429e-a6f2-4f8ca470a56e -->

When a technical issue is encountered, the party discovering the issue (whether the Crafter, a Reviewer, or another party) must determine whether the issue is either a mistake, a bug, or an exploit. The issue should also be classified as either a result of collusion or a genuine accident. The Spell Team must notify the Core Facilitator of technical issues that require input or adjustments from outside the Spell Team. Note that if a Crafter makes an error in their original development of the spell, but discovers their own mistake and corrects it before the Reviewers commence the review process, this should not be treated as a technical issue per this handling process.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.3.2 - Issue Analysis and Evidence Capture [Core]  <!-- UUID: 86a2c5ba-ae8f-4a3d-8f56-124cd27580c8 -->

Once a technical issue has been categorized as an instance of a mistake, bug or exploit, the party discovering the issue must prepare documentation of the issue. This generally involves investigating the impacts of the issue, determining how the issue arose, and documenting how the issue manifests. In cases where the issue may be non-technical in nature - such as possible instances of collusion - supporting evidence should be captured, which supports the argument that a non-technical issue may be present. This evidence should be captured in a manner that does not permit bad actors to manipulate or erase the evidence through methods such as editing or deleting messages.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.3.3 - Determining the Handling Party [Core]  <!-- UUID: b5740bb5-6895-48fe-bb16-01a9c5605eb1 -->

Once a technical issue has been classified and evidence supporting its existence is collected, an entity needs to be designated as the handling party for resolving the issue. This party will typically be the Core Facilitators. However, if there is a non-trivial chance that the Core Facilitators will ignore or downplay the issue, another entity should serve as the handling party.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.3.4 - Publicly Reporting the Issue [Core]  <!-- UUID: b9cfe356-2909-4f1b-99c9-0a4c98f826d4 -->

Discovered issues must be reported publicly unless doing so poses a threat to the security of the Sky Protocol. Technical issues that are currently or likely to become, actively exploitable must not be discussed in a public manner, as this poses a threat to the security of the Sky Protocol.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.3.5 - Resolving the Issue and Following Up [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8b86845a-6d47-4834-9d7d-36ecef988a23 -->

The Crafter or Reviewer, if they discovered the technical issue, should address or remedy the issue as necessary to resolve it. The handling party (typically the Core Facilitators) must follow up to ensure that the technical issue has been resolved. If the issue poses a threat to the Sky Protocol - such as an exploit or instance of collusion - it should be followed up on as a matter of urgency by the handling party.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.3.6 - Issue Retrospective [Core]  <!-- UUID: cffb2455-0b31-4a0c-8ec7-2de99392b236 -->

Following the resolution of a technical issue, the parties involved in the development process, or other relevant processes leading to the issue arising, must document how the issue arose. These parties (often the Crafter or Reviewer) should also detail any measures that were previously in place to prevent this type of issue occurring, and any measures that can be implemented going forward in order to prevent the same issue from occurring again in the future.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.4 - Spell Team Operational Principles [Core]  <!-- UUID: bd45083c-50de-47d2-b0c3-808c04f726e3 -->

As a core member of the Spell Team, the Crafter must comply with the Spell Team Operational Principles throughout their involvement in the spell development process. These principles apply to both spell crafting and spell reviewing processes, and have been included in the documentation of both. These principels are set out in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.4.1 - Security First [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3f01cb21-b2ef-4b09-9617-be0435998740 -->

Any choice between efficiency and security must always be made to maximize security, even at the cost of time, process inefficiency, or gas cost. Smart contract system designs as well as individual smart contracts, their code, and their interactions must always prioritize increased security over increased efficiency, reduced gas cost, or any other benefits. Rules and processes must always maximize security and safety, even at the cost of inefficiency, repetitiveness, longer review or audit timelines, or other drawbacks.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.4.2 - Attention to Detail [Core]  <!-- UUID: b5daecf9-d4fb-4291-88e0-b08b6e39688e -->

Developing, modifying or reviewing code should be done line by line. No change, issue or fix is too minor or unimportant to be commented on or addressed. Sky Core Contracts are immutable, and disabling them often requires waiting for a long period. As such, bugs and exploits should never be present in production code, as they are typically difficult to fix and their presence harms the reputation of the Sky Protocol. Any deployed contract that contains a bug indicates that the existing quality control, auditing, and review processes are not adequately preventing bugs.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.4.3 - Minimizing Complexity [Core]  <!-- UUID: 361f1e3c-e974-4f58-98bb-13c7adea4c06 -->

Smart contract system designs, as well as individual smart contracts, their code, and their interactions must always use a simpler design over a more complex design, unless the more complex design provides a significant net increase to the safety and security of the Sky Protocol.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.4.4 - Lindy-Based Risk Aversion [Core]  <!-- UUID: aa0a8049-f883-4366-9924-6651aeec14e6 -->

The "Lindy Effect" states that the longer something has been in existence in its current state, the longer its remaining life expectancy. The "Lindy" of a system or smart contract refers to the duration it has been operating in its current state and therefore implies its future stability. Specifically, the "Lindy" of immutable systems uses their history of safe and secure operation as a predictor of future safety and security. It is considered best practice to consider the "Lindy" of systems, elements,and smart contracts when evaluating their use or inclusion in the wider system of the Sky Protocol.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.4.5 - Chesterton’s Fence [Core]  <!-- UUID: e5a69e08-353b-41ad-9cff-aa2f0b8199c6 -->

Chesterton’s Fence is a principle that states that changes must not be made to the current state of affairs unless the reasoning behind the current state of affairs is understood and can be explained. Changes to the Sky Protocol must only be proposed after the context - such as the reasoning, actions, and history - leading to the thing’s current state are known and can be explained by the party proposing the change. Changes must not be approved by team members or otherwise accepted until all parties responsible for overseeing, checking, or reviewing the change are aware of the context behind the current state of affairs as it exists before the change is enacted.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.4.6 - Existing Process Adherence [Core]  <!-- UUID: c6ff5871-72bc-471a-a8fd-34f738098219 -->

All existing Sky processes and patterns, whether pertaining to rules, processes, systems, smart contracts, or code, must be complied with. If regular operation is impossible due to a technical limitation or otherwise, it is permitted so long as it does not compromise the safety or security of the Sky Protocol in any way. New patterns developed in this way must prioritize the safety and security of the Sky Protocol over all other considerations and should be as similar to old patterns as possible. However, deviation from industry norms and best practices is encouraged so long as they are made in the interest of maximizing security. Any deviations by the Crafter or Reviewers must be communicated to the Core Facilitators.

###### A.1.9.2.4.7.4.7 - Tenth Man Mandate [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5a4e1225-6151-4eb0-ae6b-5644f15b1b12 -->

If a group of people making a decision unanimously holds a certain opinion, all make the same assumption or all come to the same conclusion, it is the responsibility of one member of the group to assume that the rest of the group is incorrect. The member of the group assigned to hold this contrarian viewpoint is referred to as the ‘tenth man’ and must attempt to disprove the group’s decision. Where the ‘tenth man’ is able to provide compelling arguments against the group’s conclusion, the decision must be reassessed.

##### A.1.9.2.4.8 - Core Facilitator Creates And Finalizes Executive Document Week 2 Tuesday (Step 8) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1df24674-3095-44a7-b1b6-cb583b0787dd -->

The process for the creation, review, and finalization of the Executive Document is outlined in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.1 - Guiding Principles For Crafting The Executive Document [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1fcee4d2-912e-478c-ac81-0ce1f48054a7 -->

The Executive Document process is guided by the core values of clarity, transparency and legitimacy. The document must balance its technical and implementation-focused nature with the need to remain clear and accessible to all voters. The Core Facilitator, responsible for producing the Executive Document, must ensure adherence to these principles as outlined in the subdocuments.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.1.1 - Providing Voters With Sufficient Information [Core]  <!-- UUID: aefa846c-b4af-444a-a22e-39a9a8839410 -->

The Core Facilitator must ensure that voters have access to sufficient information to make informed decisions. This might include:

- Links to documentation or discussions related to the actions included in the Executive Document.

- Summaries of the actions included in the Executive Document, created by unbiased and knowledgeable third parties.

- Links to any analysis published by DAO-funded entities regarding the actions in the Executive Document.

- Links to well-maintained resources describing the nature of any parameters that may be changed if the Executive Proposal passes.

Providing accessible and complete information is essential to maintaining the legitimacy of the process. Voters should not later regret their vote due to a lack of understanding of the actions they voted on.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.1.2 - Ensuring Transparency And Clarity [Core]  <!-- UUID: f494539b-e704-409e-843e-361dd6959603 -->

The Core Facilitator must ensure that the Executive Document is clear, transparent, and accessible to all voters. This involves eliminating ambiguity and confusion to the greatest extent possible while balancing technical detail with readability. Voters should clearly understand:

- The effects and impacts of the Executive Vote if passed.

- The processes that led to each item being included in the Executive Document.

- The identities (pseudonymous or entity-level) of those responsible for publishing, writing, and reviewing the Executive Vote.

The goal is to ensure that voters are always provided with information on why an item is included, what will happen if the Executive Vote passes, or who is responsible for its contents.

Clarity reduces the risk of disruption, confusion, or a breakdown of legitimacy in the governance process.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.1.3 - Organizing For Maximum Impact [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3316956f-2e70-4106-92af-da4a2e26c043 -->

The Core Facilitator must organize the Executive Document to maximize readability and comprehension for voters. While transparency and access to information are essential, the document should avoid unnecessary length or complexity.

Best Practices for organization:

- Use strategic hyperlinks and text formatting to reduce the document's length while maintaining accessibility.

- Regularly review and update templates to eliminate unnecessary content.

- Present information in a logical order, prioritizing the most critical actions and details.

A concise and well-structured document increases the likelihood that voters will read, understand, and consider the actions on which they are voting.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.1.4 - Balancing Technical Detail And Accessibility [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1247b21a-b3b6-4dcd-ad5f-dbfa50d7ccfe -->

The Core Facilitator must ensure that the Executive Document balances technical detail with readability. Voters should not require in-depth technical knowledge of the Sky Protocol to understand the Executive Document.
Guidelines for Technical Detail:

- Avoid including excessive technical details that obscure clarity or clutter the Executive Document.

- Include technical details only when they are strictly necessary, such as:
    ◦ In emergency or urgent responses when technical details are the primary focus of the proposal.
    ◦ For non-urgent technical fixes or housekeeping when technical details are relevant, but should be given lower priority compared to other actions in the Executive Vote.

In cases where technical details are included, the Governance Point must ensure they fully understand the technical aspects themselves to present them accurately and clearly.

Excessive technical detail can overwhelm voters and obscure the document's primary purpose. By carefully managing technical content, the Core Facilitator ensures that the document remains accessible and focused.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.2 - Structure Of The Executive Document [Core]  <!-- UUID: 756c8cd0-9c53-4c98-8368-50d635fec7db -->

The Executive Document is a Markdown document created and stored in the executive-votes GitHub repository. It serves as the primary communication tool for presenting the contents of an Executive Vote and is divided into several key sections, each serving a specific purpose in the governance process.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.2.1 - Content And Metadata Fields [Core]  <!-- UUID: f57aab8a-efc2-42aa-83e1-367c91907777 -->

The Executive Document contains both text content and metadata fields, which are essential for its functionality and clarity. These include:

- The title field provides a concise and descriptive summary of the Executive Document, making it easy for stakeholders to identify the proposal.

- The summary field offers a high-level overview of the actions included in the spell, helping voters quickly understand the scope and purpose of the proposal.

- The date field ensures that the proposal is aligned with the governance schedule and provides a clear reference for when the spell is intended to be executed. The date specifies the Target Date of the spell in UTC time.

- The address field contains the Ethereum address of the deployed Mainnet spell on the blockchain, allowing stakeholders to verify its contents and execution status. When the Executive Vote is published on the Voting Portal the spell address is a hyperlink that links to Etherscan.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.2.2 - Markdown Headings [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6656674a-c598-474d-b8a7-64d7dda3bd91 -->

The document uses different levels of Markdown headings to organize its content into distinct sections:

- First-level heading is used for the title of the document.

- Second-level headings are used for the four major sections of the Executive Document: Executive Summary, Proposal Details, Review, and Resources.

- Third-level headings are used within the Proposal Details section to describe individual input executive actions. Each action is presented under its own third-level heading, making it easy to identify and review.

- Fourth-level headings are used to describe specific derived actions within an input action. These headings provide additional context or detail necessary for understanding the implications of the input action, such as actions triggered by a Prime spell or changes to market parameters.

This structured approach ensures that the document is both easy to navigate and comprehensive.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.2.3 - Preamble [Core]  <!-- UUID: f3b16344-ebd0-43e7-978d-e91cbebe9010 -->

The preamble serves as an introduction to the Executive Document, providing key context for voters. It identifies the entities responsible for crafting, publishing, and reviewing the proposal, ensuring accountability and transparency. Additionally, it includes a link to the voting guide, which helps new participants understand the voting process.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.2.4 - Executive Summary [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1e44fedd-79c0-4216-a533-a2c8b0f7c305 -->

The Executive Summary outlines the key actions that will occur if the proposal passes. It includes:

- The GSM Pause Delay, which specifies the minimum time before the Spell can be executed and is enforced by ds-pause.

- The Office-Hours Modifier, if applicable, which restricts execution to specific times.

- The Expiration Date of the Spell.
      ◦ The Spell must always have an expiration date; it can’t be more than 90 days in the future, and the typical expiration window is 30 days.

- A high-level explanation of the actions being performed in the Spell, presented in bullet-point form.

The summary should provide a high-level overview of the Executive Vote and ensure that SKY holders can quickly understand the scope and purpose of the proposal. This section also explains that voting for the proposal with SKY places support for these actions.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.2.5 - Proposal Details [Core]  <!-- UUID: d399f662-1b9a-40d0-b535-d3215d09cba1 -->

This section provides a detailed breakdown of each item included in the proposal. It includes:

- Input executive actions, which are presented under third-level Markdown headings. Each action includes links to the authorization and proposal documents and explains the implications of the action if the proposal passes.

- Derived actions, which are described under fourth-level Markdown headings when they provide additional context or detail necessary for understanding the implications of an input action. These headings are used to outline specific actions triggered by an input action, such as actions executed by a Prime spell or changes to market parameters. Derived actions that are overly technical, redundant, or irrelevant to the proposal's primary focus may be excluded to maintain clarity and accessibility.

This section ensures that all actions are clearly explained and linked to their reasoning and authorization documents.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.2.6 - Best Practices [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3de17a79-145a-4ec5-b43d-d8c371ee598e -->

To ensure clarity and consistency, the Governance Point should adhere to the following practices when including items in the Executive Document:

- **Headers and Bullet Points**:
    ◦ Each item should be separated by a header for clarity.
    ◦ Typically, two bullet points are included for each item: one for "Authorization" and one for "Proposal."
    ◦ The "Authorization" link may lead to an Atlas document, a Governance Poll or a Forum Post, while the "Proposal" link is usually a Forum Post.

- **Formatting for Key Values**:
    ◦ If the item involves amending a parameter or distributing funds, the relevant values should be marked in bold to emphasize the new outcomes that will take effect if the Executive Proposal passes.
    ◦ For transfers, Ethereum addresses should be included to provide transparency and direct access to transaction details.

- **Use of Tables**:
    ◦ Tables are often used in the Executive Document to provide an easy-to-read overview of key information, such as parameter changes, funding distributions, or other technical details.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.2.7 - Review Section [Core]  <!-- UUID: b6117ca8-0d19-47ad-a20e-2f6e5a55746e -->

The review section includes standardized language directing voters to the Sky Governance Forum for community debate and discussion. It encourages voters to review linked threads to inform their position before voting.

###### A.1.9.2.4.8.2.8 - Resources [Core]  <!-- UUID: aaa621d0-8886-4b32-a903-eee6e4a2f66f -->

The Core Facilitator must ensure that every item from the Executive Sheet is included in the details section of the Executive Document. These items should be presented in order of judged impact/importance. If the order of items in the Executive Document differs from the Executive Sheet, the Executive Sheet must be updated to match, maintaining consistency between the two documents.

The Core Facilitator must make sure that each item:

- Includes links to the reasoning and authorization for its inclusion.

- Provides additional links required for voters to understand the context surrounding the item’s inclusion.

- Uses future-conditional language and clearly outlines the actions that will take place if the Executive Proposal passes. For example, phrasing such as "If this Executive Proposal passes, then this action will take place" ensures clarity and avoids ambiguity.

- Has hyperlinked key parameters, terms, and contracts where appropriate, making it easier for voters to access relevant information. Ethereum and IPFS addresses should also be linked to provide direct access to technical details.

##### A.1.9.2.4.12 - Ecosystem Validators Validates Spell During Validation Window (Step 12) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 84d31eb0-fbbc-4783-a7cf-ef7dddfa8271 -->

After the Spell is live on the voting platform, the Spell must be validated by the Ecosystem Validators. The validation process is outlined in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.1 - Ecosystem Spell Validation Overview [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6be80bce-df84-4e8a-ab38-c4f2c5e7d373 -->

Ecosystem Spell Validation refers to the process of reviewing and verifying the accuracy, functionality, and compliance of a Spell's code on the blockchain. The subdocuments herein outline the key concepts, roles, and timelines involved in the validation of Spells.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.1.1 - Ecosystem Spell Validators [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1ddd532f-ac63-48d8-b873-c2d106252328 -->

Ecosystem Spell Validators are members of the Sky Ecosystem responsible for performing the Spell validation process. Currently, Aligned Delegates serve as the primary Spell validators for the Sky Ecosystem.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.1.2 - Ecosystem Spell Validation Window [Core]  <!-- UUID: 64c1fbdd-8d78-439d-810f-985734946744 -->

The Ecosystem Spell Validation Window is the period of time during which a Spell can be validated. Validation must occur:

1. After the Spell becomes visible and is available for voting on the Voting Portal (start of the validation window).

2. Before the Spell’s actions become executable, which occurs when the `GSM Pause Delay` elapses (end of the validation window).

Validation outside this window is ineffective because:

- The Spell may still be subject to changes before the start of the validation window.

- The Spell may already be executable after the end of the validation window.

The duration of the validation window is determined by the value of the GSM Pause Delay.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.1.3 - Ecosystem Spell Verification Scope [Core]  <!-- UUID: 101d5bee-6ba8-449e-9bb0-cc31bc929390 -->

The scope of Spell validation includes any code in the Sky Protocol that:

1. Must adhere to the `GSM Pause Delay` enforced by the Sky Protocol’s `ds-pause` contract, and

2. Is directly executed by the Sky Protocol’s `Pause Proxy` contract.

Actions that do not meet these criteria—such as `instant actions`, `MOM` and `IAM` contract calls—are excluded from Spell validation.

This exclusion is due to the absence of a pause delay for such actions, which prevents ecosystem actors from having sufficient time to perform their reviews.

Validators should also consider validating the source code or associated audits for contracts added to the Chainlog as part of a Spell, even if these contracts are not immediately executed or fall outside the standard validation scope. This includes pre-deployed emergency Spell contracts, ensuring that their integrity and security are assessed at the time of addition to the Chainlog for potential future use.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.2 - Tools And Resources For Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1f2d6e6a-2fc2-48ae-80ef-817a592bf446 -->

The Spell validation process requires the use of specific tools and resources to perform the necessary checks and ensure the accuracy and security of the Spell. These include online platforms, development environments, and blockchain-related utilities, as detailed in the subdocuments herein.

Many of these tools are also used during the Spell development process. Therefore, it is recommended that Spell validators rely on the same setup to ensure consistency and reliability during validation

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.2.1 - Supported Operating System For Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: e32e109f-e101-4d96-85bb-b6341773353f -->

Spell validation must be performed on macOS or a Linux-based operating system. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) may be used by Windows users, but it is not officially supported.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.2.2 - System And Language Requirement For Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8c7fe7a6-2bda-443b-8470-872ca1e341c6 -->

Spell validators are required to understand English, and the validation must be performed in English.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.2.3 - Required Programming And Command Languages For Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: ee18215c-7a45-4fda-8ede-6c3c60e27125 -->

Spell validators must use the Solidity programming language to review smart contracts and the Bash command language to execute validation scripts.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.2.4 - Recommended Browser For Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4800adb1-b0e3-4791-b80a-b27ef03e27cb -->

Firefox is recommended for Spell validation due to its wide support, strong privacy features, and speed.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.2.5 - Version Control Tools For Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: cc6f9990-ffcf-49a8-ba0a-76453155063c -->

Spell validators are strongly recommended to use Git during Spell validation, although it is not required.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.2.6 - Development Toolchain For Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 78db1070-9ab9-4e71-964d-3c73d5d9b015 -->

The Foundry toolchain is required for ecosystem validation of Spells. Spell validators should refer to the "Getting started" section in Foundry’s FoundryBook documentation for installation instructions.

The toolchain’s dependencies vary by operating system and may include:

- The Rust programming language and the Cargo package manager.

- For macOS users, the Homebrew package manager and the libusb package.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.2.7 - Mainnet Ethereum Node For Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: f26a1e7c-e189-4fa7-bd0c-05b36bb054fb -->

The validation of Spells requires access to a local or remote Mainnet Ethereum node. While the use of a local node is preferred for enhanced control and security, a remote node is recommended for most Spell validators to simplify setup and maintenance. Services like Tenderly provide a fast and reliable remote node for Ethereum Mainnet access and are often favored for their performance.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.2.8 - Using Chainlog Smart Contract For Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 42979dc0-bf99-4ba4-97a5-ccfe02845ad7 -->

Retrieving values from the Chainlog smart contract is mandatory during the validation of Spells.

The most secure method for retrieving values is to query the Chainlog directly using multiple sources, such as Foundry’s `cast` tool, the Etherscan blockchain explorer, and the IPFS link accessible on the official Chainlog for Sky at [https://chainlog.sky.money/](https://chainlog.sky.money/), ensuring that the returned addresses match across all platforms.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.2.9 - Using GitHub Website For Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0c457a50-037e-4d5f-bbff-a531c0ecf52e -->

GitHub is the platform that hosts Spell repositories, Spell code, pull requests, and public communication between Spell Team members. The use of the GitHub website is required during Spell validation to obtain the current Spell code.

While using GitHub’s web interface through a browser is not explicitly required, it is strongly recommended.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.2.10 - Using Etherscan Website For Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 230c15db-6c5a-4486-b44b-ef915db39d11 -->

The use of the Etherscan website is required when validating Spells, as it is the only blockchain explorer that displays the verified code of the current Spell’s smart contract, including its Solidity compiler version, licensing settings, optimization settings, and libraries used.

Aside from the current Spell’s smart contract, using Etherscan to make calls to, interact with, or read information from other smart contracts is not required during the validation process. Many smart contracts associated with the Sky Protocol have only been verified on Etherscan.

Automated Spell deployment and code comparison scripts within the Spell repositories may require an Etherscan API key; however, these scripts must not be used when validating Spells.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.2.11 - Using Discord For Spell Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3326e18a-a909-448b-a9b3-ee17afc87160 -->

The use of Discord is not required during Spell verification, as it primarily serves as a platform for public communication between Core Facilitators and members of the current Spell Team.

However, using Discord is highly recommended for Spell validators, as the communication history in the #new-Spells channel may provide valuable context or additional information for the validation process.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3 - Spell Validation Checks [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6668e922-1831-4cb2-b948-c528a80198eb -->

When validating a Spell, specific checks must be performed to determine whether the Spell passes or fails validation. These checks are categorized into three levels of priority:

- Required Checks: Must be completed for the Spell to pass validation.

- Recommended Checks: Should be completed to ensure best practices, but are not mandatory.

- Additional Checks: Community-developed checks that enhance the validation process.

These checks are detailed in the subdocuments.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.1 - Required Spell Validation Checks [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4aa4dc55-736c-4e5c-994c-3d99616e1d71 -->

Validators must complete the checks outlined in the subdocuments to be able to determine if a Spell passes or fails validation.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.1.1 - Spell Validators Must Ensure Tests Pass [Core]  <!-- UUID: ea1d866c-41ed-474b-91ce-d9f6428bc158 -->

Ecosystem Spell validators must execute the predefined tests associated with a Spell. These tests are provided as scripts in the Spell repository on GitHub. Validators must run these scripts to verify the correctness, security, and compatibility of the Spell. All tests must pass successfully—without errors or failures—for the Spell to pass validation.

The best practice for running the tests are specified herein:

1. If you haven’t cloned the repository before, run: `git clone <https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/Spells-mainnet`>.

2. Navigate to the Spell repository directory by running: `cd Spells-mainnet`.

3. Update the repository for the latest changes by running: `git pull`.

4. Switch to the correct branch by finding the name from the Spell’s pull request on GitHub, run the command: `git checkout NAME`.

5. Verify your setup and check that you’re on the correct branch by running: `git status`.

6. Clean up old Spell library dependencies by running the command: `rm -r lib` or deleting the `lib` folder and its contents.

7. Install libraries required for the current Spell by running `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

8. Configure the local or remote node being used by running `export ETH_RPC_URL=URL` with the URL of your local or remote node. If using a remote node, do not share the URL as it can be used maliciously.

9. Run the Spell tests by running `make test`.  If there are concerns about potential modifications to the function, validators can bypass the `make` command and directly execute the test script using `./scripts/test-dssSpell-forge.sh`.

10. Wait for completion. Allow 20 to 60 minutes for the tests to complete.

11. Review and Save Results: Save the test results (pass or fail) for logging purposes.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.1.2 - Spell Validators Must Verify Spell On Etherscan [Core]  <!-- UUID: a8bc220b-ed35-4c3a-95c3-88fb625b14ed -->

Validators must confirm that the Spell’s smart contract is verified on Etherscan.

Validation can be performed by ensuring that the source code is visible under the "Contract" tab and under "Contract Source Code" on Etherscan. If only bytecode is displayed, the contract is not verified. Additionally, the source must match the correct version in Spells-mainnet on GitHub. A Spell is considered verified if these conditions are met.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.1.3 - Spell Validators Must Validate DssExecLib Library [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2407adac-7204-4dbe-acb8-abde6e0e57e9 -->

Validators must ensure that the address of the `DssExecLib` library is correct. The correct address corresponds to the latest release as specified in the `DssExecLib` GitHub repository. The deployed Spell must use and display the correct `DssExecLib` address on Etherscan to pass validation.

The validation can be performed by navigating to the "Libraries Used" section on the "Contract tab" on Etherscan. The library address displayed there must be compared against the official address specified in the README file ([https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/dss-exec-lib?tab=readme-ov-file#dss-exec-library](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/dss-exec-lib?tab=readme-ov-file#dss-exec-library)) of the `DssExecLib` GitHub repository.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.1.4 - Spell Validators Must Check Deployed Spell Code [Core]  <!-- UUID: 438343b7-8d2a-4698-8d0f-2ab01a570ff8 -->

The Spell validator must ensure that the deployed Spell code matches the Spell code present in the GitHub Repository.

In order to pass validation, the deployed Spell must not contain any potentially malicious code or any notable functional changes within the `DssSpellAction`.

The validation for the Spell code can be done by using the `diff-deployed-Spell` script present in the Spell repository on GitHub to ensure that the deployed Spell’s code matches locally compiled code. Alternatively, an online tool like diff checker ([https://www.diffchecker.com/](https://www.diffchecker.com/)) can be used. The Spell code on Etherscan should be compared with the `DssSpell.sol` in the GitHub repository for the relevant Spell. If the Spell goes live before the code is merged to the main branch, it’s possible to find the branch by the Target Date name of the Spell (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).

When comparing, note that the following differences are acceptable and should not be flagged (based on validation guides):

- Comments: Lines starting with `//` or inside `/* */`.

- Imports and Solidity versions: Multiple declarations in the GitHub code.

- Interfaces: Numerical suffixes like `_1` or `_2` added to interface names in the contract.

- DssExecLib Interface: Extra code or warnings within the `DssExecLib` library.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.1.5 - Spell Validators Must Check Deployed Spell Is Not A DarkSpell [Core]  <!-- UUID: 354e4b28-61fd-4416-aa8b-085e40cdf920 -->

Validators must confirm that the deployed Spell does not execute an external `DssAction` contract. This validation ensures that the Spell is self-contained, does not rely on external contracts or pre-defined Ethereum addresses, and that the `DssExec` and `DssSpellAction` contracts are deployed together and not separately, as is done when using DarkSpells. Validators must perform the following two checks:

1. Check that the DssAction contract’s `execute()` function only calls the `actions()` function and does not interact with any external contracts or explicitly defined Ethereum addresses.

2. Check that the second argument used in the constructor when instantiating the `DssExec` is a newly created Spell action contract (e.g. `address(new DssSpellAction())`) and not an explicitly defined Ethereum address. This confirms that the Spell is linked to the correct action contract.

If either of these checks fails, the Spell cannot pass validation.

The validation checks can be performed by navigating to the "Contract tab" on Etherscan for the deployed Spell. In the source code, first locate the `DssAction` contract (or its equivalent, such as `DssSpellAction`). Review the `execute()` function and make sure that it only calls the `actions()` function. Then, locate the constructor and confirm that the `action` argument is instantiated as a new contract.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.1.6 - Spell Validators Must Check Deployed Spell Was Not Deployed Using CREATE2 [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0ad70737-d32f-4c50-a4ff-d3f505e171c2 -->

Validators must ensure that no contract, neither the Spell Executive contract (DssSpell / DssExec) nor the Spell Action contract (DssSpellAction / DssAction) - was deployed using the `CREATE2` opcode.

To perform this validation, the validator must:

- Locate and copy the contract creation transaction on Etherscan. The contract creation transaction can be found under the "internal transactions" tab on Etherscan.

- Use a transaction decoder, such as Tenderly or another blockchain analysis tool, to decode the transaction hash and identify the opcode used during deployment.

- Ensure the opcode is `CREATE`. If `CREATE2` is used, the Spell fails validation.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.1.7 - Spell Validators Must Check Deployed Spell Optimization Settings [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7f3112c8-ed90-4dfc-b29a-eae1d3492a11 -->

Validators must ensure that the code optimization settings used by the Spell contract are correct.
Validators should ensure the following:

- The `Optimization Enabled` field on Etherscan is set to `No with 200 runs` unless explicitly required due to contract size constraints during deployment.

- If optimization is enabled, the value of the `Optimization Enabled` must be `Yes with 200 runs` unless the optimization settings have been specified in the Instruction Document as a specific number of runs, which must be a multiple of 100 other than 0.

- If the optimization settings are incorrect (e.g., `No with 13767 runs` or `Yes with 0 runs`), the Spell fails validation.

To perform this validation, the validator must go to the contract tab on Etherscan and review the `Optimization Enabled` field under the contract’s metadata.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.1.8 - Spell Validators Must Check Deployed Spell EVM Version [Core]  <!-- UUID: a1773da6-7656-47b7-a31a-a4bd366d0d85 -->

Validators must ensure that the correct EVM version for the Spell contract is displayed on Etherscan. The EVM version is determined by the Solidity compiler version used during compilation. For the Spell to pass validation, the `Other Settings` field on Etherscan must display either "Default" or the correct default EVM version name for that compiler release (e.g., for Solidity 0.8.16, either "Default" or "London" is acceptable, as London is the default EVM for that compiler version).

To perform this validation, the validator must go to the "Contract" tab on Etherscan and review the `Other Settings` field under the contract’s metadata.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.1.9 - Spell Validators Must Perform Basic Spell Code Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 46cbc700-20e4-4a57-9508-07a6baa26fca -->

The Spell validator must perform a brief review of the Spell code. This includes reviewing the `DssSpellAction` contract within the `DssSpell.sol` file.

Validators should look for any unusual behavior, such as:

- Low-level assembly operations (e.g., `assembly` blocks).

- The use of Solidity opcodes, such as `delegatecall`, `callcode`, or `selfdestruct`.

- Suspicious-looking payments or transfers.

- Any other malicious or unauthorized code. This includes cross-checking the Solidity code in `actions()` against the Executive Sheet and the Executive Document. Each action must be authorized per the Atlas.

Spell validators must report any code they find that appears to be malicious or which likely forms part of an attempted attack. A Spell must not pass validation if the Spell validator is convinced that malicious code is present in a Spell or that its execution can lead to an attack on the Sky Protocol.

To perform this validation, the validator must go to the "Contract" tab on Etherscan and review the source code.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.2 - Recommended Spell Validation Checks [Core]  <!-- UUID: c6b18786-1c46-4960-8348-0675a8141246 -->

Validators are encouraged to perform the Spell validation checks outlined in the subdocuments to ensure adherence to best practices.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.2.1 - Spell Validators Must Check Deployed Spell License [Core]  <!-- UUID: fb60b182-3ac9-4593-b9c7-8e1eaaeaa099 -->

The correct license for the Spell contract is GNU AGPLv3. Validators should confirm that this license is used, which can be verified in one of two ways under the "Contract" tab on Etherscan:

1. In the `Other Settings` field under the contract’s metadata. The license should be displayed as `GNU AGPLv3`.

2. In the Spell Code in the commented line of code in the `DssSpell` contract. The line should contain: `SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later`.

While the Spell should use the correct license to pass validation, this is not considered a strict requirement.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.2.2 - Spell Validators Must Check Compiler Version [Core]  <!-- UUID: 83f53a73-7e2f-4dc9-a371-e19238924bf3 -->

Validators should ensure that the Solidity compiler version used in the deployed Spell matches the version specified in the `Spells-mainnet` repository on GitHub. Validators should verify this by:

- Navigate to the "Contract" tab on Etherscan and check the `Compiler Version` field under the contract’s metadata. The version displayed must match the version specified in the `DssSpell.sol` contract (e.g., pragma solidity `0.8.16`;).

- Only the first part of the version (e.g., `v0.8.16`) needs to match; any additional commit information can be ignored.

While the Spell should use the correct version to pass validation, this is not considered a strict requirement.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3 - Additional Community Developed Spell Validation Checks [Core]  <!-- UUID: 56b1cc27-a9e3-4099-8f1f-648da7d1c56b -->

The community has developed additional checks to enhance the Spell validation process. These checks are outlined in the subdocuments.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.1 - Spell Validators Should Validate Executive Document [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2662dc31-d68b-4b63-91d9-8ca420632eb2 -->

The Spell validator should confirm that the smart contract developers referenced the correct governance copy when building the Spell and that the document voters see on the Voting Portal matches the Spell contents. This is done by verifying that the hash in the Spell corresponds to the version of the Executive Document stored in the GitHub repository.

To perform this validation, the validator must first locate the Executive Hash, which can be found on the voting platform under "Spell Details" for the Executive Vote. Validators should be aware that the hash refers to an earlier commit of the Executive Document markdown, prior to the inclusion of the contract address. After validating the hash against this earlier commit, validators must conduct a diff check between the commit associated with the Executive Hash and the final version of the document to confirm that the only difference is the replacement of the Spell address placeholder.

- The check can be performed in two ways:

1. Using an Online Tool:

  ◦ Copy and paste the body of the Executive Document from GitHub into the online Keccak-256 hash generator tool ([https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html)).

  ◦ Compare the generated hash with the hash included in the Spell.

 2. Using `cast`

  - Generate the hash directly from the raw GitHub URL at the specific commit:
     - Run the following command to generate the hash: `cast keccak -- "$(wget $RAW_EXEC_URL -O -)"`
     - Use the raw file URL at the specific commit.

  - Compare the generated hash with the hash included in the Spell.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.2 - Spell Validators Should Review Spell Constructor [Core]  <!-- UUID: b28afb60-f8cc-4529-9775-1a3a0e22efed -->

Validators should ensure that the Spell constructor is properly implemented. The constructor is a critical part of the Spell contract, as it defines key parameters such as the Spell's expiry time and the inclusion of the `DssSpellAction` code block, which specifies the actions the Spell will execute.

Validators should follow these steps to review the constructor:

- Navigate to the "Contract" tab on Etherscan and scroll to the bottom of the contract source code to locate the constructor declaration.

    ◦ Verify that the Spell inherits from the `DssExec` contract, which serves as the base contract for all Sky Spells.

    ◦ Verify that the constructor is properly implemented with the correct parameters. For example, the expiry time should be set to the correct duration (e.g., `30 days`).

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.3 - Spell Validators Should Review Spell Actions [Core]  <!-- UUID: 97f4831e-1566-46e1-bbac-2a668e4b5ca7 -->

Validators should ensure that all values before and after the Spell actions are constants or immutable. If values are not constants, they could present malicious code in the form of memory mutations impacting the function of the pause proxy.

To perform this validation, the validator must go to the "Contract" tab on Etherscan and review the source code.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.4 - Spell Validators Should Review Office Hours Function [Core]  <!-- UUID: 39f67b68-ad24-40b3-9cda-6aaa6006722f -->

Validators should verify that the office hours function matches the Executive Document. If this function is missing from the Spell Action, the code will default to the true state (office hours on).

To perform this validation, the validator must go to the "Contract" tab on Etherscan and review the source code.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.5 - Spell Validators Should Review Chainlog [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4f7f2b2f-3514-4ba6-a1a2-6dd40fff5a92 -->

Spell validators should ensure that all `DssExecLib` calls to the chainlog use the correct name descriptors.

- Verify that all Chainlog references, such as name descriptors or keys, correspond to valid, existing entries in the Chainlog.

- Confirm that the name descriptors match the expected values as recorded in the Chainlog.

- The chainlog patch version is updated correctly (e.g., `x.y.z` → `x.y.z+1`).

To perform this validation the validators must go to the "Contract" tab on Etherscan and review the source code. Look for `DssExecLib` calls in the code. Compare the name descriptors in the code with the expected values in the Chainlog.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.6 - Spell Validators Should Review Oracle Address [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9a7a0d5e-ac6a-481d-ae61-d6504969524e -->

Spell validators should ensure that oracle addresses are correctly verified.

To perform this validation the validators should go to the Chainlog and locate the relevant oracle (e.g. `PIP_ETH`). Take the contract address listed in the Chainlog to Etherscan. Open the "Read" tab of the contract on Etherscan. Look for the `src` value. Verify that the `src` value matches the `MedianETHUSDcontract` address referenced in the Spell.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.7 - Spell Validators Should Review Constants [Core]  <!-- UUID: a6940e22-f25c-4f29-9307-328b7f590ce7 -->

Validators should ensure that the rates are defined as per-second accumulation values, using the correct precision units common in the Sky Protocol (e.g., RAY for rates, RAD for debt/DAI amounts, WAD for general token amounts).

**Precision Units Overview**:

- **WAD (10^18)**: Used for token amounts and balances.

- **RAD (10^45)**: Used for debt values, ceilings, or large accumulations.

- **RAY (10^27)**: Used for rates and multipliers.

These units prevent floating-point issues in Solidity — always confirm they're applied correctly to avoid overflows or miscalculations. Group this with general constant validations (e.g., ensuring hardcoded values like fees or ceilings are computed accurately).

Rate values can be validated against the commented rate by using the `bc` command in a bash shell. Using the `NEW_FEE` variable in the example contract the following is visible: `bc -l <<< 'scale=27; e( l(1.095)/(60 * 60 * 24 * 365) )`. This produces 1.000000002877801985002875644. Removing the decimal place will allow you to see that this matches the definition of `NEW_FEE`.

Validating all rate adjustments can be done the same way. For more information on the rates module, refer to the developer guide ([https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/developerguides/blob/master/mcd/intro-rate-mechanism/intro-rate-mechanism.md](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/developerguides/blob/master/mcd/intro-rate-mechanism/intro-rate-mechanism.md)). For easy reference, common pre-computed rates can also be viewed at the following ipfs link ([https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmefQMseb3AiTapiAKKexdKHig8wroKuZbmLtPLv4u2YwW](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmefQMseb3AiTapiAKKexdKHig8wroKuZbmLtPLv4u2YwW)).

Immediately prior to making rate changes, `drip` must be called on the respective contracts.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.8 - Spell Validators Should Review Timestamps [Core]  <!-- UUID: 353d7fab-461c-4141-b0b5-24a91357ee4d -->

Validators should ensure that all timestamps in the Spell (e.g., ETAs, expirations, or delays like GSM Pause) are calculated correctly and use Unix timestamp format (seconds since epoch) to prevent execution issues, such as invalid timings or reverts. Use the `make time` command in Spells-mainnet to validate these.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.9 - Spell Validators Should Review Require Statements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2f10b68b-e398-45de-bb9a-62f832e22e7a -->

Validators should confirm that all `require` statements in the Spell's code are used only as sanity checks and not under normal conditions or inputs (e.g., the Spell should not revert during expected execution)

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.10 - Spell Validators Should Review Contract For Unusual Elements [Core]  <!-- UUID: de343461-5583-4157-b71a-a15e3e3b1ad1 -->

Validators should assess whether any unusual or unexpected elements appear in the contract. It could be:

- Hidden state changes: Look for retrieval functions (e.g., `get` or `view`) that include assignments (`=`), indicating state changes.

- External Calls At The End: Check for external calls (e.g., `.call`, `.send`, `.transfer`) made after state changes, as this could indicate potential reentrancy attacks.

- Force Ether, DAI or SKY Reception: Look for a `receive` function with no logic, which could forcibly receive assets.

- Use of `tx.origin`: The tx.origin variable refers to the address that started the current transaction. If `tx.origin` is used instead of `msg.sender` in decision-making processes, it could lead to unintended authorization.

- Function Naming Overlaps: A contract might have function names that are similar or overlap with common Solidity functions to mislead a reviewer. Check for misleading function names (e.g., `transfer`, `approve`, `mint`) with unexpected logic or assignments.

To perform this validation the validator must go to the "Contract" tab on Etherscan and review the source code.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.11 - Spell Validators Should Do Spell Tests And Repository Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: a564f010-a30f-40bb-bf36-12f91f30b8fe -->

Validators should check the following:

- Ensure that all dependencies in the Spell repository (e.g., imported libraries like dss-exec-lib or git submodules) are current and up to date with the Spell. To perform this check the validator must browse or clone the GitHub repository (e.g., Spells-mainnet). Review Solidity files (e.g., in src/) for import statements, check the .gitmodules file for submodules, and run `git submodule status` to verify versions. Compare against source repositories for updates, then test with `make test` to confirm compatibility. The source repository can be identified in the Spell's source code, as the imported library or dependency is followed by "from", which points to the source path (e.g., `import {GemAbstract} from "dss-interfaces/ERC/GemAbstract.sol";` points to dss-interfaces.)

- Verify that the test scripts themselves have not been tampered with or maliciously modified in the repository.

- Confirm that the Spell repository branch matches the branch specified in the pull request or governance proposal.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.12 - Spell Validators Should Verify The Contract ABI [Core]  <!-- UUID: fdcea934-c3fb-4735-acc3-3e320ad89b00 -->

Validators should verify that the contract ABI (Application Binary Interface) is correctly generated and matches the deployed contract.

To perform this check, the validator must go to the "Contract" tab on Etherscan and the "Contract ABI" section. Copy the ABI JSON and compare it against the expected ABI from the official GitHub repository (e.g., Spells-mainnet repo). To obtain the expected ABI from the GitHub repository download the relevant Solidity file, paste it into a tool like Remix IDE, select the matching compiler version, and compile to extract the ABI JSON. Use a diff tool to check for exact matches in functions, parameters, and types.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.3.3.13 - Spell Validators Should Check For Hidden Or Unverified Contracts [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4674dbfa-77d8-4d99-980e-330342b0ffa9 -->

Validators should check for hidden or unverified contracts linked to the Spell (e.g., libraries or proxies).

To perform these checks, the validator must go to the "Contract" tab on Etherscan and review the source code. Scan the code for any referenced contracts or addresses: Look for imports, inherited contracts, hardcoded addresses, or function calls to external contracts. If it's an address, search it directly on Etherscan and confirm it's verified (e.g., green checkmark with available source code). Compare the referenced code to the official GitHub repository (e.g., Spells-mainnet repo) to ensure versions match and nothing has been altered.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.4 - Validation Outcome Reporting [Core]  <!-- UUID: 43d2fe19-727f-4722-b913-7d5f79e1a2a7 -->

The Spell validator is responsible for reporting the outcome of the validation process. This includes determining whether the Spell passes or fails validation, documenting any issues discovered during the validation process, and ensuring that all issues are resolved before the Spell can be classified as passing validation. The process for reporting, including how to report and to whom issues should be reported, is detailed in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.4.1 - Spell Passing Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6f0fce93-7274-4cb1-921e-d120989294b4 -->

A Spell is classified as passing validation when:

1. All validation checks are completed without identifying issues, or

2. All reported issues have been resolved to the satisfaction of the Spell validator

Validation of the Spell should ideally be public, though this is not mandatory.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.4.2 - Spell Failing Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 66a80a93-fcfa-48d5-819e-99489288fa83 -->

A Spell is classified as failing validation when:

1. One or more issues are identified during validation, or

2. Reported issues remain unresolved to the satisfaction of the Spell validator.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.4.3 - Reporting Issues Found During Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6ea115ff-4554-4c3c-b3d5-a0407972de6a -->

Issues discovered during validation must be reported as follows:

1. Mandatory Reporting: If the validation check is required, the issue must be reported immediately.

2. Recommended Reporting: If the validation check is recommended, validators are strongly encouraged to report issues unless they are certain the issue is not malicious, a bug, or an attack on the Sky Protocol.

3. Out-of-Scope Issues: Any issues found outside the scope of validation checks should also be reported as soon as it is found.

In general, any issue that appears functional or potentially functional should be reported.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.4.4 - Resolving Issues [Core]  <!-- UUID: eca405af-edd5-42a9-8bec-4a9e49bcd090 -->

When an issue has been reported by a Spell validator, the Core Facilitators or the Spell Team who worked on the Spell are likely to respond to the issue. The Spell validator must assume that the parties providing the answer are acting maliciously and lying to prevent the discovery of their attack.

The validator may only consider the issue as resolved once they are comfortable that the issue does not constitute a bug or attack that poses a threat to the Sky Protocol. Only the validator who raised the issue is permitted to consider an issue as resolved, and any unresolved issue will prevent the Spell from passing validation.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.4.5 - Primary Reporting Counterparty [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8bd3523a-751f-4371-a20e-b267680410ad -->

Issues found during the Spell validation should be reported to all Core Facilitators, not a single Facilitator, to mitigate the risk of compromised or malicious actors.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.4.6 - Secondary Reporting Counterparty [Core]  <!-- UUID: 813e403a-2ffb-463c-b9ac-1cc6653ba755 -->

If a validator suspects that Core Facilitators are malicious or colluding, they must notify Sky Governance by reporting the issues they found publicly. This permits Sky Governance community to independently investigate the issue and act together to mitigate an attack, even if all Core Facilitators are compromised or acting maliciously.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.4.7 - Private Validation Status Reporting [Core]  <!-- UUID: 55d6723f-c93d-4a81-ad4e-e55cfd8b096c -->

Privately reporting issues found during Ecosystem Spell Validation is only recommended where the private communication involves a group of Core Facilitators, as a single Core Facilitator may be acting maliciously and provide false information. Private reporting of issues can be performed using platforms such as Discord or Signal.

###### A.1.9.2.4.12.4.8 - Public Validation Status Reporting [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2a14eed2-f334-410c-a669-d055ed0a9e59 -->

Publicly reporting issues found during Spell validation is the recommended method of issue reporting. Issues reported publicly may be reported to Core Facilitators using the "#new-Spells" channel in the Sky Builder Discord Group. In cases of potentially malicious Core Facilitators, issues should be reported to Aligned Delegates and wider Sky Governance using the "#governance" channel in the Sky Builder Discord Group. In cases where this is not possible, posts made to the Sky Forum may be used; however, these should be used as a last resort as they will likely cause a slower response time.

##### A.1.9.2.4.13 - Spell Execution Process And Retro (Step 13) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 761cd866-17a9-47f5-8ae6-ab1788371be1 -->

The subdocuments herein provide a detailed breakdown of the technical steps involved in the execution of Spells and follow-ups after Spell execution.

###### A.1.9.2.4.13.1 - Outcome Of The Executive Proposal Vote [Core]  <!-- UUID: d87a286e-ebfa-477b-8d03-b69c6fead235 -->

When an Executive Proposal is ready for a vote by Sky Governance, SKY holders cast their votes. The voting process determines whether the Executive Proposal gains enough support to move forward to the execution phase. If the executive does not accumulate sufficient SKY to "move the hat" (i.e., reach the required threshold for approval), it does not proceed to execution immediately; however, it can still gain support and be executed later within the expiration window. For official Spells, there is a 30-day expiration period after deployment. Once this period lapses, the Spell process ends, and no further actions can be taken for the associated Spell. If the executive gains enough support to be approved, the process moves forward to the execution phase.

###### A.1.9.2.4.13.2 - Lifting the Spell [Core]  <!-- UUID: ee6fc86b-99da-4782-bc7f-7c01e5bbcd81 -->

Before a Spell can be scheduled for execution, it must be "lifted" to become the active "hat" in the DSChief contract. To lift a Spell, that Spell must have more approvals than the current hat. This action is permissionless, meaning any Ethereum address can trigger the execution without requiring special permissions.

###### A.1.9.2.4.13.2.1 - Chief-keeper [Core]  <!-- UUID: f31bd0d0-fc5b-4c86-9b84-30c4b010c986 -->

The chief-keeper monitors and interacts with DSChief and DSSSpells. When a Spell receives more approval than the current hat, the chief-keeper calls the `lift` function to make this Spell the new hat. After confirming hat status, the chief-keeper proceeds to schedule the Spell, ensuring that only the current hat is scheduled for execution.

###### A.1.9.2.4.13.3 - Execution Setup For Approved Vote [Core]  <!-- UUID: e06f6a83-7c74-4abd-b4da-771cbfdf2fb9 -->

If the executive is approved and has been lifted to become the current hat in the DSChief, a future action to execute the Spell's actions is prepared by calling `schedule()` on the Spell contract. This action is permissionless, meaning any Ethereum address can trigger the execution without requiring special permissions. This process involves calling `plot` on `ds-pause` with four parameters related to the Spell action contract:

- The address of the Spell action contract.

- The `extcodehash` value of the Spell action contract.

- Any `calldata` information required for the future execution of the Spell contract's actions using `execute()`.

- The `eta`, which is the earliest time the Spell's actions can be executed. This must be scheduled at least the duration of the pause delay into the future.

Once the Spell's actions are "plotted" in the Pause, the Spell is considered `scheduled`, and the countdown to the `eta` time begins. In the absence of Office Hours, this countdown is typically equal to the duration of the `GSM Pause Delay`. If Office Hours are set to "Yes" then the countdown will be equal to the `GSM Pause Delay` plus whatever time is needed to enter the Office Hours window.

###### A.1.9.2.4.13.4 - Casting And Execution Of Approved Spell [Core]  <!-- UUID: a900623d-15e0-4fc6-a393-bae5da03c139 -->

Once the current time exceeds the `eta` value set during scheduling, the Spell can be `cast` (see [A.1.9.2.4.13.3 - Execution Setup For Approved Vote](e06f6a83-7c74-4abd-b4da-771cbfdf2fb9)). Casting and the subsequent execution path occur atomically within the same transaction. This entire process is permissionless, meaning any Ethereum address can trigger the execution without requiring special permissions.

###### A.1.9.2.4.13.4.1 - Casting Of Spell [Core]  <!-- UUID: cdd724f1-5cc7-48df-81f7-25c6a932a184 -->

When the `cast` function in the DssSpell contract is called:

- The Spell is marked as `cast`, preventing it from being executed again.

- The `cast` function initiates the execution process by calling the `exec` function in the `ds-pause` contract.

###### A.1.9.2.4.13.4.2 - Execution Of Spell [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8ee36ed9-cae6-462b-a6b4-9aa5479fee18 -->

Within the same transaction initiated by `cast()`, ds-pause proceeds as follows:

1. Validation and Removal: The `exec` function in `ds-pause` validates the execution request and removes it from the list of scheduled executions.

2. Delegate Call to Spell Action Contract: The `ds-pause` contract calls `exec` on the Pause Proxy contract, which performs a `delegatecall` to the Spell action contract address specified during scheduling.

3. Execution of Spell Actions:
    ◦ For regular Spells, the Pause Proxy calls the `execute()` function on the `DssSpellAction` contract.
    ◦ The `execute()` function calls the `actions()` function, where the Spell’s actions are carried out.

4. Error Handling: If the transaction reverts at any point (e.g., due to an error in `actions()`), the Pause Proxy halts execution.

5. Final Checks: If the transaction succeeds, the `exec` function in `ds-pause` performs a final ownership check to ensure the Pause Proxy is still owned by `ds-pause`.

6. Completion: Once the final check passes, the execution of `cast()` is finalized, marking the end of the process.

The Spell Crafter initiates a retrospective on the Spell in the existing Spell thread in the `#govops` Discord channel. The Spell Crafter prefaces the message with `initiating retro`. The Spell Crafter should include any problems identified during the Spell, including concrete improvement proposals. If there is nothing to discuss, the Spell Crafter should communicate that (e.g `Initiating retro: nothing to discuss from my side`).

###### A.1.9.2.4.13.5.2 - Spell Crafter Conducts Any Needed Follow Up Regarding Megapoker [Core]  <!-- UUID: e3009714-a46c-43b9-8f90-d09bd2e816b6 -->

If any changes related to Megapoker were made in the Spell (e.g., oracles replaced, collaterals onboarded or offboarded), the Spell Crafter should inform the Ecosystem Actor responsible for maintaining Megapoker and ensure the contract is updated.

The following steps are necessary to ensure the Megapoker contract is updated:

- Coordinate with Ecosystem Actor responsible for maintaining Megapoker and TechOps

- Previous code patterns are followed

- Megapoker changes are reviewed and approved

- CI and local tests pass

- New Megapoker contract is deployed

- New deployed Megapoker contract address is handed to TechOps

#### A.1.9.2.5 - Voting Process For Executive Votes [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3aa5bc98-91ce-4588-b345-a96af8ba2366 -->

The subdocuments herein provide a high-level summary of the voting process for Executive Votes within the Sky Protocol.

##### A.1.9.2.5.1 - Voting Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 441d8bef-e71a-4621-bc03-353821865031 -->

Participation in Executive Votes requires access to SKY for voting, the governance token of the Sky Protocol, whether through direct ownership or delegated authority. Voters can connect their Ethereum wallet to the official voting platform (accessible at [https://vote.sky.money](https://vote.sky.money/)) to allocate their SKY vote-weight in support of an active proposal, or directly via onchain transactions using other interfaces or smart contract interactions. Voting incurs a gas fee, as it is an onchain transaction. SKY tokens can be used directly by holders or delegated to representatives like Aligned Delegates or Shadow Delegates, who vote on behalf of token holders see [A.1.9.2.2.4 - SKY Holders](3e1d0486-4805-4bed-a246-f75198e111e6). There is no minimum SKY amount required to vote, and each SKY token carries equal voting rights, ensuring a democratic process where cumulative vote-weight determines a proposal’s chance of execution.

##### A.1.9.2.5.2 - Voting Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: c888b306-369e-4db4-98cc-75beddc3689a -->

Once an Executive Vote is live on the Voting Portal, it enters the Ecosystem Spell Validation Window, a critical period for community review. For more details of the validation process see [A.1.9.2.4.12 - Ecosystem Validators Validates Spell During Validation Window (Step 12)](84d31eb0-fbbc-4783-a7cf-ef7dddfa8271).

##### A.1.9.2.5.3 - Continuous Approval Voting [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9b43b664-fcfc-484e-9faa-5ca0ffabd10e -->

Executive Votes operate under a Continuous Approval Voting mechanism. Voters can support multiple proposals by allocating their SKY vote-weight to each, with the goal of helping a favored proposal surpass the current "hat"—the proposal with the most approval in the DSChief contract. Voters can apply their full SKY vote-weight to up to 5 different proposals simultaneously (as defined by the `max_yays` limit in the contract), rather than splitting their tokens between them. If SKY token holders disagree with a new proposal, they can redirect their SKY vote-weight to the inactive proposal with the highest vote-weight (often the last successfully passed proposal) to maintain the status quo or support an alternative. An active proposal can become the hat if it accumulates more votes than any other, including the current hat, at which point it is "lifted" to become the new hat. This lifting process marks the active proposal, and it may now be scheduled and later executed, provided it meets other conditions like the GSM Pause Delay. There are three key aspects to Continuous Approval Voting:

- Victory threshold set by the hat: The vote-weight on the current hat proposal establishes the "victory threshold" that new proposals must exceed to become eligible for execution. This ensures only the most supported changes advance.

- Dynamic vote-weight movement: Vote-weight can shift from the hat to a new proposal, simultaneously lowering the victory threshold for the hat while boosting the new proposal’s chances. This fluidity allows for real-time community consensus shifts.

- Securing the hat: Vote-weight is encouraged to remain on the hat proposal even after it’s lifted, acting as a security measure against "rogue" or less-supported proposals that might attempt to overtake it with minimal backing.

##### A.1.9.2.5.4 - Voting Outcome [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9c5cae66-1317-43e9-bd85-041a9d8b5623 -->

The voting outcome is determined by the amount of SKY vote-weight allocated to the Executive Vote. If a proposal does not receive more SKY vote-weight than the current hat, it will not be scheduled for execution and will eventually expire; SKY holders can continue supporting it or redirect their vote-weight to another proposal, often the previously approved one, to maintain the status quo. For details of the execution process see [A.1.9.2.4.13 - Spell Execution Process And Retro (Step 13)](761cd866-17a9-47f5-8ae6-ab1788371be1).

### A.1.9.3 - Governance Security Delay Requirements [Section]  <!-- UUID: c5f0e955-0441-42e0-a6fc-eab875bba568 -->

This subdocuments herein define critical processes and requirements concerning the Governance Security Module (GSM) Pause Delay.

#### A.1.9.3.1 - Pause Delay [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3c9545d9-775f-4149-88bf-7d297b5302c6 -->

The GSM (Governance Security Module) Pause Delay parameter sets the minimum amount of time after an Executive Vote has passed before changes will come into effect in the Sky Protocol. 

Once an Executive Vote passes, the GSM Pause Delay must pass before the changes within that Executive Vote can affect the Sky Protocol. The Sky Protocol only has one GSM Pause Delay, and all parameter changes are subject to it. The GSM Pause Delay is usually expressed in terms of hours.

It is possible to move functionality outside of the GSM Pause Delay; however, this requires additional engineering work. A list of exceptional functionality can be found in [A.1.9.3.2 - Exceptions](6781594b-5dff-45ec-89a4-1c9684c4eed8).

##### A.1.9.3.1.1 - Pause Delay Adjustment [Core]  <!-- UUID: bcf9f14d-9c9b-4b3f-b417-a7e52fca0399 -->

Adjusting the GSM Pause Delay parameter is a manual process that requires an Executive Vote. Changes to the GSM Pause Delay are subject to the pre-change GSM Pause Delay.

An increase to the GSM Pause Delay parameter should be considered if the risk of governance attack is considered especially high for whatever reason. In the past, the GSM Pause Delay has been increased due to the risk from flash loans combined with increased liquidity of the SKY token on the open market.

A decrease should be considered if time-critical governance actions are projected to be needed in the near future. For example, if extreme market volatility is expected, it may be beneficial to reduce the GSM Pause Delay temporarily to allow Governance to better react to changing conditions.

##### A.1.9.3.1.2 - Pause Delay Current Value [Core]  <!-- UUID: db442d8a-8d98-47a2-b162-01c2adc22b67 -->

The GSM Pause Delay is: 24 hours

#### A.1.9.3.2 - Exceptions [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6781594b-5dff-45ec-89a4-1c9684c4eed8 -->

The current exceptions to the GSM Pause Delay are specified in the subdocuments herein.

##### A.1.9.3.2.1 - Executive Drop Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3041b5f2-36f4-49c5-b1ca-f0c97d6e63b2 -->

The MCD_PAUSE contract manages the general governance timelock of the GSM Pause Delay; however, it also contains an in-built exception to its own rule.

The executive drop functionality allows a successful governance proposal to cancel a previous governance proposal that has not yet passed the GSM Pause Delay period and been executed. As in any other situation, the new Executive proposal must be the hat proposal, meaning more SKY is voting for it than is voting for any other Executive proposal.

This functionality allows Sky Governance to prevent a malicious attack on the protocol if they are able to exceed the attacker’s SKY weight before the GSM Pause Delay expires.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that a malicious attacker may be able to delay or permanently block a legitimate governance proposal.

##### A.1.9.3.2.2 - Oracle Freeze Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: e604c477-e8e4-483f-a41e-c93dcff3acfd -->

The OSM_MOM contract manages the freezing of Sky’s oracles. The freeze functionality allows a successful governance proposal to immediately freeze the oracle price for any or all of the vault types in the Sky Protocol. Once frozen, the oracle price will remain at its current value.

The oracle cannot be unfrozen without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay as part of a regular governance proposal.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that the oracles may be frozen by an attacker in order to either:

- Prevent an expensive liquidation.

- Take advantage of a significant drop in collateral prices to mint unbacked USDS.

##### A.1.9.3.2.3 - Debt Ceiling Breaker Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: cd57f7e4-6acd-431e-97fd-89c3453c8eba -->

The LINE_MOM contract manages the breaker for the Debt Ceilings of a configurable subset of the vault types in the Sky Protocol. This Debt Ceiling Breaker allows a successful governance proposal to reduce the debt ceilings of a pre-configured whitelist of vault types to zero without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay to expire.

The Debt Ceiling Breaker affects both the Debt Ceiling and the Maximum Debt Ceiling of a given vault type when activated, disabling the Dynamic Debt Ceiling functionality for that vault type if enabled. To reverse the effect, parameters of affected vault types must be reconfigured with an Executive Vote which is subject to the GSM Pause Delay.

The whitelist may be configured via a successful governance proposal, but must wait for the GSM Pause Delay before changes come into effect. The whitelist is defined in [A.1.9.3.2.3.1 - Debt Ceiling Breaker Exception Whitelist](4937205a-5be0-4def-9b7f-00f9f3bff421) and can be changed via the Weekly Governance Cycle.

###### A.1.9.3.2.3.1 - Debt Ceiling Breaker Exception Whitelist [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4937205a-5be0-4def-9b7f-00f9f3bff421 -->

##### A.1.9.3.2.4 - Liquidations Circuit Breaker Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: 54b41b8f-8104-47b9-a115-14a4a9716cf7 -->

The CLIPPER_MOM contract manages the circuit breaker for vault types using Liquidations 2.0. The circuit breaker functionality allows a successful governance proposal to impose Sky Governance’s choice of limitations on liquidations for any or all of the vault types in the Sky Protocol.

- Level 0 - Liquidations Enabled - The breaker is not tripped, new vaults can be liquidated and old liquidations can proceed.

- Level 1 - New Liquidations Disabled - No new liquidations can take place.

- Level 2 - New Liquidations and Resets Disabled - No new liquidations can take place. No existing auctions can be reset if they expire.

- Level 3 - All Liquidations Disabled - No new liquidations, no resets, no bidding in active auctions.

This functionality is exceptional because liquidations at non-market prices have the potential to be irreversibly damaging to both users and the Sky Protocol. The circuit breaker allows Sky Governance to attempt to limit the damage in the event of an issue affecting liquidations without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay.

Additionally, the contract allows for permissionless activation of the circuit breaker, if the price decrease in a collateral exceeds a preset percentage value between oracle price updates. The permissionless activation triggers the circuit breaker at Level 2 because both new auctions and resets reference the current oracle price.

When Level (0, 1, 2, 3) of liquidations circuit breaker is altered via Executive Vote, Sky Governance has the ability to set locked time, which is a specified duration which needs to pass before the liquidations circuit breaker can be triggered again via permissionless activation.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that liquidations may be halted by an attacker in order to either:

- Prevent an expensive liquidation.

- Take advantage of a significant drop in collateral prices to mint unbacked USDS.

###### A.1.9.3.2.4.1 - Liquidations Circuit Breaker Exception Price Tolerance [Core]  <!-- UUID: a228410a-353b-45dc-8f26-aae54ad8bf44 -->

Breaker Price Tolerance is a parameter which determines the condition for the permissionless activation of circuit breaker. Adjusting the Breaker Price Tolerance requires an Executive Vote, which is subject to GSM Pause Delay.

The Breaker Price Tolerance is expressed as a number between zero and one, and works with the following equation: `next_oracle_price < current_oracle_price * breaker_price_tolerance`.

In instances where the price oracle model does not support the price delay function, the permissionless activation of the liquidation circuit breaker ceases to function, since there is no next oracle price.

###### A.1.9.3.2.4.1.1 - Liquidations Circuit Breaker Exception Price Tolerance Current Value [Core]  <!-- UUID: cd377adf-aee4-42b2-9bbc-0e4a69570e0b -->

The Breaker Price Tolerance is: 0.5

##### A.1.9.3.2.5 - Direct Deposit Breaker Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2a0f27c9-7468-465d-9e07-19481f5e8c89 -->

The DIRECT_MOM contract manages the breaker for Direct Deposit Modules (D3Ms). The breaker functionality allows a successful governance proposal to disable any or all of the active D3Ms. In practice, this will set the bar parameter to zero, which (contrary to intuition) disables the module by setting the allowed Debt Ceiling to zero. At this point, no further USDS can be minted through the Direct Deposit Module. To reverse the effect, parameters of affected Direct Deposit Modules must be reconfigured with an Executive Vote which is subject to GSM Pause Delay.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that a given line of USDS credit is unexpectedly shut down. This has the potential to disrupt the protocol in question, which may impact Sky indirectly.

##### A.1.9.3.2.6 - Dynamic Debt Ceiling Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: d07e74b5-2faa-4d4d-9b4f-eb6ea72e8768 -->

The MCD_IAM_AUTO_LINE contract manages the debt ceiling parameters for many of Sky’s vault types according to preset rules. Keepers can use the contract to attempt to maintain a Target Available Debt in a given vault type. The contract modifies the debt ceiling up or down to maintain a level of available debt.

This functionality is exceptional so that the Sky protocol can react to changes in debt demand more quickly than waiting for the GSM Pause Delay.

The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is a theoretical griefing attack on the IAM that prevents debt from being accessible in affected vault types.

##### A.1.9.3.2.7 - SparkLend Freezer Mom Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: 645443f1-9004-48d3-868c-139b608bb1f9 -->

The SparkLend FREEZER_MOM contract allows Sky Governance to bypass the GSM Pause Delay to either freeze or pause any markets in SparkLend. The contract also allows the undoing of such actions for any market in SparkLend.

This functionality allows Sky Governance to react faster in an emergency. Freezing markets does not allow for new supplies or borrows, while pause restricts all market functionality, including deposits/withdrawals/borrows/repays and liquidations.

##### A.1.9.3.2.8 - Smart Burn Engine Breaker Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5247c795-7f9d-4d3f-a040-6bc9b070e2d4 -->

The SPLITTER_MOM contract allows for the disabling of the Smart Burn Engine without the GSM Pause Delay.

This functionality is available so that Sky Governance can react to emergencies regarding the Smart Burn Engine.

Since the Splitter contract also allocates USDS from the Surplus Buffer to USDS Staking Rewards, the activation of SPLITTER_MOM also disables these rewards until the activation is reversed by Sky Governance.

##### A.1.9.3.2.9 - PSM Breaker Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: 704fbaff-fa10-4c63-af5b-3ee5fd1ea6a8 -->

The LITE_PSM_MOM contract manages the breaker for swaps through the LitePSM. The PSM Breaker allows a successful governance proposal to halt swaps through the LitePSM.

##### A.1.9.3.2.10 - Bounded External Access Modules [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5533c091-e638-4c3d-92e8-43e3e7026078 -->

Bounded External Access Modules (BEAMs) are contracts that allow whitelisted operators to manage parameters in the Sky Ecosystem without needing to use the standard Executive Vote process. Thus, parameter changes enacted via these modules are not subject to the GSM Pause Delay.

The actions of BEAMs are limited by risk parameters, which are set by Sky Core Governance and require an Executive Vote to change.

###### A.1.9.3.2.10.1 - Bounded External Access Module Risk Disclosure [Core]  <!-- UUID: b2bffec7-2a62-43a1-bfed-1e38370ac086 -->

BEAMs allow whitelisted operators greater flexibility to respond to market movements when setting parameters in the Sky Ecosystem. This flexibility introduces additional risk since operators are able to bypass the Executive Vote process when changing the parameters relevant to the BEAM that they operate.

This risk can be mitigated by limiting the frequency and size of modifications that can be made by operators in parameters controlled by Sky Core. All BEAMs should also have a related MOM contract that can deactivate the relevant BEAM in the event of an operator acting in a misaligned manner.

Any operator that fails to follow the defined procedures for a BEAM they are operating should be considered misaligned.

###### A.1.9.3.2.10.2 - Stability Parameter Bounded External Access Module Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: 12bb55dc-8f44-4f7a-a7f8-bf197a278784 -->

The Stability Parameter Bounded External Access Module (SP-BEAM) MCD_SPBEAM contract manages the rates applied to Sky Protocol’s native vaults as well as the savings rates. Whitelisted operators can use the SP-BEAM to modify rates without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay. The SP-BEAM modifies rates up or down within specified parameters. See [A.3.7.1.3 - Stability Parameter Bounded External Access Module](47b8b035-8abd-42e6-86b8-33f852fa953a). 

This functionality allows the Sky Protocol to react to changes in market rates more quickly than waiting for an Executive Vote and the GSM Pause Delay.

The risk opened up by this functionality is malicious action by whitelisted operators setting rates to undesirable values. This risk can be mitigated through the SP-BEAM parameters and the SPBEAM_MOM.

###### A.1.9.3.2.10.3 - stUSDS Bounded External Access Module Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5ce20b57-b8bb-4a67-b5b6-a28b707e2cb2 -->

The stUSDS Bounded External Access Module (stUSDS BEAM) manages the parameters of the stUSDS system. Whitelisted operators can use the stUSDS BEAM to modify certain stUSDS parameters without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay. The stUSDS BEAM modifies stUSDS parameters within specified ranges. See [A.4.4.1.3.8 - stUSDS Bounded External Access Module](37f8f82e-7239-4cfb-8f95-d2cc40515cd9). 

This functionality allows the Sky Protocol to update stUSDS parameters more quickly than waiting for an Executive Vote and the GSM Pause Delay.

The risk opened up by this functionality is malicious action by whitelisted operators setting stUSDS parameters to undesirable values. This risk can be mitigated through the stUSDS BEAM parameters and the STUSDS_MOM.

##### A.1.9.3.2.11 - Stability Parameter Bounded External Access Module Breaker Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1fd7d164-e9f3-4d6c-ab5e-0122bb415f8d -->

The SPBEAM_MOM contract allows Sky Governance to bypass the GSM Pause Delay and disable the Stability Parameter Bounded External Access Module.

This functionality allows Sky Governance to react more quickly in an emergency, e.g., if an operator of the SP-BEAM is hacked or is a malicious actor. Once the SPBEAM_MOM is activated, the SP-BEAM will not be able to change any rates in the system. If the SPBEAM_MOM has been triggered, it will still be possible to modify rates through the usual Executive Vote process, subject to the GSM Pause Delay.

##### A.1.9.3.2.12 - stUSDS Bounded External Access Module Breaker Exception [Core]  <!-- UUID: b9f3824c-31a5-472c-8a53-8166f3eeb7ee -->

The STUSDS_MOM contract allows Sky Governance to bypass the GSM Pause Delay and disable the stUSDS Bounded External Access Module or set the `cap` or `line` stUSDS parameters to zero.

This functionality allows Sky Governance to react more quickly in an emergency, e.g., if an operator of the stUSDS BEAM is hacked or is a malicious actor. Once the STUSDS_MOM is activated to disable the stUSDS BEAM, the stUSDS BEAM will not be able to change any stUSDS parameters in the system. If the STUSDS_MOM has been triggered, it will still be possible to modify stUSDS parameters through the usual Executive Vote process, subject to the GSM Pause Delay.

##### A.1.9.3.2.13 - Linear Interpolation Module [Core]  <!-- UUID: 60767684-f67f-4e03-85db-7718af41b827 -->

The Linear Interpolation Module (`lerp`) is a smart contract tool that allows a governance parameter to be adjusted on a straight-line basis over time, without requiring additional Executive Votes. The Linear Interpolation Module refers to the smart contract logic that enables time-based parameter changes. To deploy individual `lerp` instances, each of which manages the adjustment of a specific parameter over time, the Linear Interpolation Module Factory contract is used. Once authorized through an Executive Vote, the `lerp` may enact parameter changes without being subject to the GSM Pause Delay. The subdocuments herein specify the features of the `lerp` and its authorized use.

###### A.1.9.3.2.13.1 - Linear Interpolation Module Features [Core]  <!-- UUID: c21d4246-8294-4f30-b69d-3d6056247893 -->

The `lerp` must be activated in an Executive Vote but can thereafter change the value of the designated parameter without additional Executive Votes. Each `lerp` instance is defined in terms of a `start` value, representing the desired starting value, an `end` value, representing the desired ending value, and a `duration` over which the parameter will be adjusted between the starting value and the ending value. Any user can then permissionlessly call `tick` to set the governance parameter to the appropriate value based on the time elapsed.

###### A.1.9.3.2.13.1.1 - Linear Interpolation Module Parameters [Core]  <!-- UUID: ac2fb8ab-4137-4243-8f75-1817f8529a70 -->

Each `lerp` instance has the following parameters:
    
◦ `target` - The target contract in which a parameter is being changed    
◦ `what` - The name of the parameter being changed    
◦ `startTime` - The starting time of this `lerp` instance    
◦ `start` - The starting value of that parameter    
◦ `end` - The ending value of that parameter    
◦ `duration` - How long this `lerp` instance will run for    
◦ `done` - Indicates whether this given `lerp` instance is completed or not

###### A.1.9.3.2.13.1.2 - Linear Interpolation Module Factory [Core]  <!-- UUID: 59fecdcf-6d2b-4a2d-96bf-af1729fc2bf9 -->

`lerp` instances are created using a factory contract LERP_FAB that contains standard logic for creating those instances and maintains a registry of all active `lerp` instances. The contract may also be used to cancel an existing `lerp` instance through the `remove` function. The factory contract provides a `list` method that lists the addresses of all active `lerp` instances, as well as a `tall` (short for "tick all") method that calls `tick` on all active contracts.

###### A.1.9.3.2.13.2 - Linear Interpolation Module Usage Process Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2de4d031-e079-415e-b982-66a4efa78c05 -->

The subdocuments herein define the governance process for using the Linear Interpolation Module.

###### A.1.9.3.2.13.2.1 - Linear Interpolation Module Authorization [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9652bd2c-f51c-42bb-9240-701e9723f574 -->

The Facilitators responsible for the Scope that governs the parameter to be adjusted by the Linear Interpolation Module, in consultation with the Core Council Risk Advisor, may recommend deploying the Linear Interpolation Module for parameter adjustments.

###### A.1.9.3.2.13.2.1.1 - Linear Interpolation Module Consideration [Core]  <!-- UUID: dd631146-0227-4fe3-87dd-085d0c909879 -->

The Facilitators must take into consideration the benefits and costs with using the Linear Interpolation Module. A longer `duration` has the benefit of adjusting the parameter more slowly, giving users more time to adjust. However, the drawback of a longer `duration` is that the parameter will not reach its desired `end` value for a longer period of time. When the cost of a parameter not being at its desired value is high, use of the Linear Interpolation Module is not appropriate, and the parameter should be adjusted to its desired value following the required process.

###### A.1.9.3.2.13.2.1.2 - Governance Process For Linear Interpolation Module [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3a075a4b-4071-4993-8210-5a87d13203b2 -->

The process to utilize the Linear Interpolation Module to adjust a parameter must follow the same governance process required to modify the designated parameter. If the parameter can be updated directly through an Executive Vote, then utilizing the Linear Interpolation Module to adjust it may also be included directly in an Executive Vote. If modifying the parameter requires a prior Governance Poll, then utilizing the Linear Interpolation Module for that parameter must also be preceded by a Governance Poll.

#### A.1.9.4.1 - Solana LayerZero Bridge [Core]  <!-- UUID: 56593663-55e5-45d5-8682-5eede11aa14a -->

Sky uses a LayerZero bridge to securely move assets between Ethereum Mainnet and Solana, as well as to provide governance controls for Sky-issued tokens on Solana. Additional details regarding the Solana LayerZero Bridge will be specified in a future iteration of the Atlas.

##### A.1.9.4.1.1 - Introduction [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1157a0cd-9acc-4149-9258-d7f8946df475 -->

The Solana LayerZero Bridge consists of both a Token Bridge that allows bridging USDS between Ethereum Mainnet and Solana as well as a Governance Bridge that allows exercising governance control for Sky-issued tokens on Solana. The Solana LayerZero Bridge replaces the existing Wormhole bridge, which will be deactivated following the first phase of deployment of the LayerZero bridge.

The Solana LayerZero bridge serves as the template for future bridges that will be deployed by the Sky Ecosystem across other blockchains.

##### A.1.9.4.1.2 - Deployment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 593095a6-aec4-4ca5-9c2e-87ce748ac198 -->

The Solana LayerZero Bridge will be deployed in two phases. The first phase will occur in the November 13th Executive Vote and the second phase will occur in a subsequent Out-Of-Schedule Executive Vote. The timing and contents of these phases may be modified by the Core Facilitator in consultation with relevant Ecosystem Actors.

The Ethereum LayerZero Freezer Multisig can only be used in urgent or emergency situations (e.g., potential code exploits). Such situations are characterized by the fact that 1) they have the potential to harm the Sky Ecosystem or its users; and 2) the preparation time required for an Executive Vote would leave the ecosystem vulnerable to harm (e.g., an exploit).

The multisig should be used to prevent technical vulnerabilities; prevent unwanted functionality of the smart contracts or corresponding parts of the system (e.g., price oracles); or prevent unwanted usage of the smart contracts or corresponding parts of the system which deviates from intended behavior.

The Core Council must ensure that use of the multisig is generally aligned and specifically accords with these requirements.

###### A.1.9.4.1.3.1.1.5 - Ethereum LayerZero Freezer Multisig Modification [Core]  <!-- UUID: af5b97be-bf52-431d-8fa9-9b1c6164e328 -->

###### A.1.9.4.1.3.2 - Rate Limits [Core]  <!-- UUID: 36626f77-52da-4bb6-9e32-851420133922 -->

The documents herein define the rate limits for the Solana LayerZero Bridge.

###### A.1.9.4.1.3.2.1 - Rate Limit Accounting [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7c0eeee4-ce0d-45fe-8eab-1be501e367c0 -->

The Solana LayerZero Bridge uses net accounting.

Net accounting means that the rate limit applies to the net amount of tokens transferred from one side of the bridge to the other. For example, if 25,000,000 USDS were transferred from Ethereum Mainnet to Solana and 15,000,000 USDS were transferred from Solana to Ethereum Mainnet, the net amount transferred would be 10,000,000 USDS.

###### A.1.9.4.1.3.2.2 - Rate Limit [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8414b48b-932e-430e-a236-727807fd73ba -->

The Solana LayerZero Bridge currently has a rate limit of 10,000,000 USDS per day. This limit should be gradually increased over time as the bridge becomes more mature.

The rate limit for the Solana LayerZero Bridge may be modified by the Core Facilitator, in consultation with the Core Council Risk Advisor, through the Operational Weekly Cycle. Such modifications can be effected directly via an Executive Vote, without requiring a prior Governance Poll.

###### A.1.9.4.1.3.3 - Validators [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6d04b42a-9e3c-4490-840a-dbe98388ee78 -->

#### A.1.9.4.2 - Spark Agent [Core]  <!-- UUID: fe525e67-1142-4312-bab7-bd9549747f77 -->

Spark is one of the initial Agents focused on developing crypto on-chain lending engines. Spark will be governed by Spark token holders pursuant to the conditions specified in the Atlas.

SparkLend Protocol is the first such on-chain lending engine, structured as a Conduit in the upcoming Allocation System. SparkLend will be adopted by Spark once Agents are launched.

The subdocuments below outline the governance security procedures specifically in development for the SparkLend Protocol.

##### A.1.9.4.2.1 - Multisig Freeze Of SparkLend [Core]  <!-- UUID: df709091-a82b-4bd6-ab05-42c56a49d326 -->

In addition to the SparkLend Freezer Mom contract defined in [A.1.9.3.2.7 - SparkLend Freezer Mom Exception](645443f1-9004-48d3-868c-139b608bb1f9), an external SparkLend Security Access Multisig has been established that allows for pausing and/or freezing SparkLend markets. The SparkLend Security Access Multisig can enable or disable the SparkLend Freezer Mom contract without the need for inclusion in a spell through the standard Executive Vote process. 

Each action executed by the multisig, including any function calls and their parameters, must be reported to the Sky community within a reasonable time frame through a post on the Sky Forum. Such actions include activating or disabling the pause or freeze function.

###### A.1.9.4.2.1.1 - SparkLend Multisig Usage Standards [Core]  <!-- UUID: 95dd3a55-eff4-4d5c-971d-c9bb8a145d36 -->

The SparkLend Security Access Multisig can only be used in urgent or emergency situations (e.g., potential code exploits). Such situations are characterized by the fact that 1) they have the potential to harm the Sky Ecosystem or SparkLend users; and 2) the preparation time required for an Executive Vote would leave the ecosystem vulnerable to harm (e.g., an exploit).

The multisig should be used to prevent technical vulnerabilities; prevent unwanted functionality of the smart contracts or corresponding parts of the system (e.g., price oracles); or prevent unwanted usage of the smart contracts or corresponding parts of the system which deviates from intended behavior.

The Multisig can also be used in cases where a vulnerability or exploit is discovered in other protocols using the same codebase as SparkLend, and a timely action can prevent or mitigate the damage. 

The Governance Facilitators must ensure that use of the multisig is generally aligned and specifically accords with the requirements defined herein.

###### A.1.9.4.2.1.1.0.3.1 - Same Codebase - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: d373ebcb-c746-4388-885c-d1bba4edbf05 -->

The element "same codebase" refers to the fact that SparkLend is based on the Aave codebase. Vulnerabilities or exploits discovered within Aave, or any other protocol utilizing the Aave codebase, could potentially be replicated and affect SparkLend.

###### A.1.9.4.2.1.1.0.4.1 - Facilitators Must Exercise Due Caution In Reviewing Use Of Multisig [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 71898c9e-1bb5-43fb-95bb-e9aeec2bdd0c -->

The list of instances justifying use of the multisig in the Target Document is not intended to be exhaustive. However, the Facilitators must exercise due caution in reviewing and validating use of the multisig in edge cases, i.e., use of the multisig that falls outside of the examples provided in the Target Document. In such "edge cases," the Facilitators must ensure that a postmortem is publicly published on the Sky Forum which justifies the use of the multisig. The Facilitators should also consider proposing an edit to the Target Document so that the edge case is explicitly included in the examples provided in the Target Document.

###### A.1.9.4.2.1.2 - SparkLend Multisig Number Of Signers [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0c71e677-9acb-4f89-bb25-1726e8dac076 -->

The SparkLend Security Access Multisig currently has a 3/5 signing requirement.

###### A.1.9.4.2.1.3 - SparkLend Multisig Current Signers [Core]  <!-- UUID: 526a954b-5939-47d0-aacf-fdc190f71d5e -->

The SparkLend Security Access Multisig currently has the following signers:

◦ VoteWizard
◦ LDR
◦ Hexonaut
◦ MonetSupply
◦ LucasManuel

###### A.1.9.4.2.1.4 - SparkLend Multisig Signer Modifications [Core]  <!-- UUID: d8e0d76b-dd1f-4f3e-9a8b-7724ce4fc880 -->

Modification of the signers of the SparkLend Security Access Multisig must be approved through a Governance Poll; no Executive Vote is required.

The only exceptions to this are if: 1) a signer self-reports a loss of access to their private key due to any reason; or 2) a signer explicitly expresses their wish to be removed as a signer. In both cases, the signer is required to communicate the loss of access to their private key, or the wish to be removed as a signer, in the form of a public Sky Forum post. The specific signer should be replaced as soon as possible, which does not require a Governance Poll.

Any changes to the multisig signers that do not fall within the two exceptions listed above, or that have not been ratified by Sky Governance, should be questioned immediately and treated as malicious. The Governance Facilitators should consider preparing an expedited Executive Vote so that Sky Governance can vote on removing external security access from the multisig.

###### A.1.9.4.2.1.5 - SparkLend Multisig Address [Core]  <!-- UUID: 13ad3a13-d446-40db-9db6-18ab34fe049a -->

The current whitelisted SparkLend Security Access Multisig address is:

`0x44efFc473e81632B12486866AA1678edbb7BEeC3`

###### A.1.9.4.2.1.0.3.1 - Multisig - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 1844a8bf-ad90-413c-9278-129379dc17bb -->

The element "multisig" refers to a blockchain wallet implemented as a smart contract and requiring multiple signers to approve transactions.

A blockchain wallet has an address associated with it and can hold cryptocurrency assets as well as interact with smart contracts. The address of a blockchain wallet may be granted privileged access to interact with other smart contracts, allowing the owner of the wallet to perform functions not available to other users.

A multisig allows the control of a wallet to be shared among the signers based on specified parameters, including the number of signers and how many signers are needed to approve each transaction. This allows a wallet to be more safely managed: for instance, a multisig prevents the possibility that a single signer could take malicious action and allows the signers to be updated if necessary.

### A.1.9.5 - Emergency Spells [Section]  <!-- UUID: b8266c11-3a84-4bbe-abe2-de9474f74ffd -->

The subdocuments herein govern the management of emergencies whose resolution requires an Executive Vote.

#### A.1.9.5.1 - Emergency Spells Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: b28a2439-3d64-4e64-aaa1-d7a58090d3a0 -->

Emergency Spells are expedited ad hoc spells that, while typically compliant with all customary quality-assurance processes, do not adhere to the normal spell cadence. Emergency Spells solve the root issue of an emergency / urgent situation impacting the Protocol and are used when a rapid response time is needed. The Support and Governance Facilitators are responsible for managing the use of Emergency Spells pursuant to [A.1.8.1.4 - Facilitators’ Roles And Responsibilities](c9c32f24-cf6c-43d5-ac4c-bd2b4d02032b) and [A.1.8.1.5.4.1 - Known And Uncontentious Remedies](3f5f79fa-698c-42db-a941-ead5a5d0aa48).

#### A.1.9.5.2 - Standby Spells [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5e40b575-4eda-4a6b-ae63-15a046cfb35d -->

A subset of Emergency Spells is Standby Spells.

Standby Spells allow Sky Governance to bypass the GSM Pause Delay and directly perform crucial actions such as stopping an oracle, setting a debt ceiling to zero, disabling a D3M integration, or stopping liquidations for a collateral. Standby Spells or the factory contracts used to deploy them are reusable, meaning they can be executed several times if needed, or voted on again on a later date to be executed again.

The subdocuments herein specify the authorized use of Standby Spells.

##### A.1.9.5.2.1 - Standby Spells Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 022b27ab-220d-4411-bfc8-5d09681ecc48 -->

Sky Protocol uses circuit-breakers to mitigate undesired scenarios, which circuit-breakers are called MOM contracts. MOM contracts must first be triggered through a spell, after which they bypass the GSM Pause Delay and can immediately act on the Protocol. See [A.1.9.3.2 - Exceptions](6781594b-5dff-45ec-89a4-1c9684c4eed8).

In emergency scenarios, time is a scarce resource. Therefore, Standby Spells are used in validated emergency scenarios to trigger a MOM contract. In an emergency situation, spell teams can then focus on crafting an ad hoc Emergency Spell to solve the root cause of an issue, if appropriate. Due to Standby Spells, it is no longer necessary in an emergency for spell teams to spend time crafting and reviewing a spell whose sole purpose is to trigger a mitigation of the issue, i.e., the MOM contract.

Standby Spells open new attack vectors that must be mitigated pursuant to [A.1.9.5.2.3.3 - ADs’ Role In Standby Spells](53cea69b-45cc-4f9c-b863-9bf259e37deb).

###### A.1.9.5.2.1.1 - Standby Spell Incorporation Into New MOM Contracts [Core]  <!-- UUID: 646ed712-24c6-4b77-9d2d-2599be50f325 -->

Each new MOM contract created must incorporate a Standby Spell or Standby Spell factory, which can be used to create new Standby Spells that can trigger the MOM contract. With a Standby Spell per every MOM contract, the generation of technical debt can be avoided.

##### A.1.9.5.2.2 - Available Standby Spells [Core]  <!-- UUID: bd8bf8d3-e98f-48ae-91c0-a5f671c21cba -->

The currently available Standby Spells are defined in the subdocuments herein. The following list of Standby Spells is not exhaustive: that is, Core GovOps, in collaboration with the Emergency Response Group and spell teams, have the discretion to develop and use a Standby Spell that is not listed in the subdocuments below. When that occurs, however, Core GovOps must ensure that the new Standby Spell is subsequently added to the subdocuments below.

###### A.1.9.5.2.2.1 - Single-Collateral Standby Spells [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8b1f9d33-ed32-4fa9-88b9-19f39c4a4af6 -->

The subdocuments herein define currently available single-collateral Standby Spells. For each instance of use, single-collateral Standby Spell contracts require a transaction to deploy the Standby Spell from a factory.

###### A.1.9.5.2.2.1.1 - SingleOsmStopSpell [Core]  <!-- UUID: d84fd214-6fba-4a0d-a624-e054968ccacc -->

This Standby Spell can be used in an emergency to freeze an OSM for a single collateral. If the oracle price provider fails for any reason, Governance can act before the OSM registers the next price; this allows for the problem to be fixed with no impact on the system.

###### A.1.9.5.2.2.1.2 - SingleDdmDisableSpell [Core]  <!-- UUID: dedab114-26eb-49d3-987c-2ca8e95eeeb4 -->

This Standby Spell can be used in an emergency to disable a D3M integration. If a D3M partner is experiencing a problem such as a hack, this emergency spell can be used to prevent abuse. While it cannot recover Dai already injected into the compromised protocol, the Emergency Spell can prevent additional exposure.

###### A.1.9.5.2.2.1.3 - SingleLitePsmHaltFactory [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7c763597-d1df-48b3-8aed-625f77f517e4 -->

This Standby Spell can be used in an emergency to halt a LitePSM completely.

###### A.1.9.5.2.2.2 - Grouped Standby Spells [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2f9fb16b-b71f-4423-85f5-b366e84e261e -->

The subdocuments herein define currently available grouped Standby Spells. For each instance of use, grouped Standby Spell contracts require a transaction to deploy the Standby Spell from a factory. Unlike single-collateral Standby Spells, a grouped Standby Spell is configured at the time of deployment with a specific list of collaterals it can operate on. This setup enables a single grouped Standby Spell to operate on multiple related collaterals.

###### A.1.9.5.2.2.2.1 - GroupedLineWipeSpell [Core]  <!-- UUID: 844d0f55-0f7a-40a8-b2e6-8e5ce72c73b3 -->

This Standby Spell will perform a Line MOM Wipe (set debt ceiling to zero) for the specified collaterals. It can be used if the specified collaterals fail - for example, if a stablecoin depegs or the protocol that provides the token is hacked. Users will still be able to exit their positions, but no new debt will be allowed to be created for the collaterals.

###### A.1.9.5.2.2.2.2 - GroupedClipBreakerSpell [Core]  <!-- UUID: d51e41f6-c29d-4476-92c2-ceae38ddca9c -->

This Standby Spell can be used in an emergency to stop liquidations for the specified collaterals.

###### A.1.9.5.2.2.3 - Multi-Collateral Standby Spells [Core]  <!-- UUID: a43090f2-f8a6-4703-ac02-47f3cad16529 -->

The subdocuments herein define currently available multi-collateral Standby Spells. Multi-collateral Standby Spell contracts are spells in themselves and are thus reusable; beyond the initial deployment of the contract, no further deployment is needed.

###### A.1.9.5.2.2.3.1 - MultiLineWipeSpell [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8b4f7c2e-817c-40f8-9b2c-d1a3f907fe3a -->

This Standby Spell will wipe all lines, setting the debt ceilings for all collaterals (lines) to zero. Users will still be able to exit their positions, but no new debt will be allowed to be created for any collateral.

###### A.1.9.5.2.2.3.2 - MultiClipBreakerSpell [Core]  <!-- UUID: f5587483-d4cb-452d-b3ad-a5f565a36275 -->

This Standby Spell will freeze liquidations for all collaterals.

###### A.1.9.5.2.2.3.3 - MultiOsmStopSpell [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4cc57ff9-576e-4e35-a166-06e4e1e287a6 -->

This Standby Spell will freeze all OSMs. If the oracle price provider fails for any reason, Governance can act before the OSM registers the next price; this allows for the problem to be fixed with no impact on the system.

###### A.1.9.5.2.2.4 - Global Standby Spells [Core]  <!-- UUID: ea6670a4-58d9-4608-8240-32c098b3db11 -->

The subdocuments herein define currently available global Standby Spells. Global Standby Spell contracts are spells in themselves and are thus reusable; beyond the initial deployment of the contract, no further deployment is needed. Global Standby Spells differ from multi-collateral Standby Spells in that the former operates on the Protocol globally and not on some set of collaterals.

#### A.1.9.5.3 - Protego [Core]  <!-- UUID: 13cdbb75-527a-4b68-b02e-90641881dbe6 -->

Protego is a contract that allows Sky Governance to cancel the execution of planned governance actions that are awaiting the expiration of the Governance Security Module Pause Delay (GSM Pause Delay). See [A.1.9.3.1 - Pause Delay](3c9545d9-775f-4149-88bf-7d297b5302c6). The subdocuments herein specify the features of the Protego contract and its authorized use.

##### A.1.9.5.3.1 - Protego Features [Core]  <!-- UUID: 152e5205-8fed-4240-aa0c-00fd433d3542 -->

The Protego contract allows canceling the execution of planned governance actions within the Sky Protocol. Technical updates and other protocol changes are implemented as Spells within the Sky Protocol, approved by Sky Governance via Executive Votes. These planned governance actions have a time delay before taking effect. In this period between approval and execution, the Protego contract allows for planned governance actions to be canceled. The documents herein specify the core features of the Protego contract.

###### A.1.9.5.3.1.1 - Emergency Drop Spells [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4f5e346e-5ed4-4e2e-a463-19cbcfb5021c -->

The Protego contract can be used to deploy an Emergency Drop Spell. Once authorized by Sky Governance, the Emergency Drop Spell can cancel any planned governance action that is awaiting GSM Pause Delay expiration.

###### A.1.9.5.3.1.1.1 - Deployment Of Emergency Drop Spells [Core]  <!-- UUID: 583c1a98-b63a-42fa-b29e-ce0688dcdaf6 -->

Any user can permissionlessly deploy an Emergency Drop Spell by invoking the `deploy` function on the Protego contract with parameters identifying the planned governance action to be canceled:

`deploy(address _usr, bytes32 _tag, bytes memory _fax, uint256 _eta)(address)`

The parameters of the `deploy` function are defined in [A.1.9.5.3.1.3 - Protego Parameters](55195cdc-90c3-4133-a0e4-792444b60ed8).

Once an Emergency Drop Spell has been deployed, it can be used to cancel the execution of the planned governance action by invoking its `drop` function. This function can only be invoked if the Emergency Drop Spell has been granted authority by Sky Governance by giving the Emergency Drop Spell the `hat` in the Chief contract.

###### A.1.9.5.3.1.2 - Allowing Permissionless Cancellation Of Planned Governance Actions [Core]  <!-- UUID: 540d277c-cc25-4e1b-b17e-3a13001483ba -->

The Protego contract can be granted authority by Sky Governance to allow any user to permissionlessly cancel any planned governance action. This is done by giving the Protego contract the `hat` in the Chief contract. Once the Protego contract has been granted authority, any user can cancel either a single planned governance action or a set of planned governance actions as specified herein.

###### A.1.9.5.3.1.2.1 - Permissionless Cancellation Of Single Planned Governance Action [Core]  <!-- UUID: e4e3c3d9-939d-43ef-9f7a-64f5d4cfe7d6 -->

If the Protego contract has authority from Sky Governance, any user can permissionlessly invoke the `drop` function to cancel a specified Spell:

`/// @notice Permissionlessly drop anything that has been planned on the pause.
drop(address _usr, bytes32 _tag, bytes memory _fax, uint256 _eta)`

The parameters of the `drop` function are defined in [A.1.9.5.3.1.3 - Protego Parameters](55195cdc-90c3-4133-a0e4-792444b60ed8).

If the Protego contract has authority from Sky Governance, any user can permissionlessly invoke the `drop` function to cancel a specified set of Spells:

`/// @notice Drop multiple plans in a single call.
drop(Plan[] calldata plans)`

The parameter of the `drop` function is defined in [A.1.9.5.3.1.3 - Protego Parameters](55195cdc-90c3-4133-a0e4-792444b60ed8).

The `plans` parameter is an array of scheduled Spells to be canceled. Each scheduled Spell to be canceled is represented as a `Plan` struct:

`/**
 * @notice A struct representing a plan.
 * @param usr The address of the scheduled spell.
 * @param tag The tag identifying the address.
 * @param fax The encoded call to be made in \`usr\`.
 * @param eta The expiration time.

The Operational Weekly Cycle may be used to edit the Atlas only if the pertinent Atlas document specifies that it, or a related unit of governance logic which it expressly controls, is modifiable through the Operational Weekly Cycle.

The general rule is that an Operational Weekly Cycle proposal requires a Governance Poll followed by an Executive Vote. The general rule, by default, is assumed wherever the Atlas provides that a document, or a unit of governance logic controlled by said document, is modifiable through the Operational Weekly Cycle.

Any exception to the general rule must be specifically stated in the pertinent Atlas document. The possible exceptions include documents that can be modified subject to a Governance Poll only; and documents that can be modified subject to an Executive Vote only, without requiring a previous Governance Poll.

#### A.1.10.1.2 - Definitions [Core]  <!-- UUID: a7c4d100-e2ae-481a-aeca-de95a78cef73 -->

The subdocuments herein contain essential definitions pertinent to the Operational Weekly Cycle.

##### A.1.10.1.2.1 - Definition Of Weekly Poll [Core]  <!-- UUID: cae731e3-0828-42ce-ae53-259c5c54cb79 -->

A Weekly Poll ("Governance Poll" or "Poll") is a non-binding poll that determines the bi-weekly Executive Vote contents. In this context, a non-binding weekly poll refers to the fact that a weekly poll cannot change the system parameters independently; it merely dictates what will be included in the next Executive Vote.

Governance Polls occur on-chain and are used to measure the sentiment of SKY voters. Polls often run concurrently, allowing voters to participate in any number of them at the same time. Polls may have different formats like Binary Voting, Instant Run-Off Voting, or Approval Voting depending on the topic. The voting period of a given Governance Poll varies; the most common are three (3) and fourteen (14) day periods. Concurrently-posted polls do not necessarily have the same voting periods.

##### A.1.10.1.2.2 - Definition Of Non-Standard Weekly Poll [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5dafd6fc-525a-4adf-bbc1-62ba5018e11f -->

A Non-Standard Weekly Poll is a non-binding weekly poll that has arbitrary time-sensitive decisions that SKY holders have to make in a relatively short period of time. The use of Non-Standard Weekly Polls is exclusive to Facilitators and is limited to situations where the Weekly Governance Cycle is determined to operate too slowly to be usable.

##### A.1.10.1.2.3 - Definition Of Executive Vote [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8bde129a-49a5-4f68-a82f-9995b86a1aa3 -->

An Executive Vote (also "Executive") is a formalized governance proposal that requires on-chain voting. Through the Executive Vote mechanism, SKY holders steward Sky Governance by voting on Executive proposals that pertain to operations maintaining the Protocol. Executive Votes execute technical changes to the Sky Protocol.

The Executive Vote occurs approximately every two weeks. Its contents are often determined by weekly Governance Polls that pre-approve the inclusion of proposals in the Executive Vote. However, the Atlas can explicitly authorize proposals to go directly to an Executive Vote.

Note that the terms ‘Executive’ and ‘spell’ are distinct concepts. 

The term ‘Executive’ or ‘Executive Vote’ is used in all instances where the formal governance vote is being referenced. The term ‘Executive Process’ refers to the end-to-end process of the development of an Executive Vote, in which Facilitators, spell teams (also referred to collectively as the "Governance Security Engineering Team") and other recognized Ecosystem Actors participate. 

The term ‘spell’ refers to the smart contract that executes the changes to the protocol approved by Sky Governance in an Executive Vote. Generally, when referring to spell team operations and their technical outcome or product (including code base, code operations, code reviews and code quality), the term ‘spell’ will be used. 

The term ‘spell process’ refers to the end-to-end process of developing a spell, a process in which the Core Facilitator and the current spell team participate. The term ‘spell development process’ is a subset of the ‘spell process’ and pertains solely to the technical development of the spell by the current spell team.

#### A.1.10.1.3 - Full Cycle Breakdown [Core]  <!-- UUID: 22508894-e015-4f7c-9ee8-24ac13756d31 -->

Every Monday, the Operational Weekly Cycle begins. It implements standard recurring operational decisions, proposed in the form of polls.

Operational Weekly Cycle proposals ("proposals") can be proposed by Facilitators and recognized Ecosystem Actors. The proposals should be posted to the Sky Forum by Friday at 8:00 am UTC to ensure the Core Facilitator have sufficient time to prepare the needed polls for the following Monday.

After confirming that the proposer has the authority to request a poll, the Facilitator must post an explicit approval of the poll request as a reply to the proposer’s Forum thread. The Core Facilitator must then prepare and publish the Governance Poll.

The Operational Weekly Cycle polls run for three days.

The outcome of the polls determines the contents of the upcoming Executive Vote.

The Core Facilitator confirm the Executive Vote contents and deliver the Executive Sheet to the spell team. The spell team prepares and reviews the Mainnet spell. The spell team deploys the Mainnet spell; and then creates and reviews a Mainnet fork.

The Core Facilitator add the Executive Vote to the Voting Portal and communicate this to the Sky Ecosystem community. The Executive Vote has an expiration of thirty (30) days; if an Executive proposal does not pass within this timeframe, it expires and can no longer have any effect on the Sky Protocol.

##### A.1.10.1.3.0.3.1 - Executive Sheet - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 52aef6ac-9eda-4795-9dab-73ea85b8ca31 -->

The Executive Sheet refers to a Google Sheets document located at [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_z5WpqxzwreCcaveB2Ye1PP5B8QAHDglzyxKHG3CHw/edit?gid=1593813984#gid=1593813984](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_z5WpqxzwreCcaveB2Ye1PP5B8QAHDglzyxKHG3CHw/edit?gid=1593813984#gid=1593813984). The Executive Sheet contains a list of content which is planned to be included in a given spell. The Executive Sheet is prepared by the Core Facilitator.

##### A.1.10.1.3.0.3.2 - Operational Weekly Cycle - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: afe57048-78b8-4deb-9dde-971c49f2f442 -->

Previously, the "Operational Weekly Cycle" was called simply the "Weekly Governance Cycle." With the introduction of the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle, it became necessary to divide the Weekly Governance Cycle into two (2) subtypes: the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle and the Operational Weekly Cycle. These two subtypes differ in terms of the permissioned parties authorized to trigger a proposal and the governance mechanisms involved. For instance, the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle implements edits to the Atlas via the mechanism of a Governance Poll only. The Operational Weekly Cycle can action changes to the Protocol that require Atlas edits, and generally requires both a Governance Poll and an Executive Vote.

##### A.1.10.1.3.0.3.3 - Upcoming Executive Vote - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 830b65d8-9a05-4960-a41f-7309d1b07bbb -->

Successfully polled changes to the Sky Protocol are included in an Executive Vote that is typically conducted within approximately 30 days of the poll passing. The exact timing is dependent on the decisions made by the Core Facilitator and the spell teams.

#### A.1.10.1.4 - Executive Vote Contingencies [Core]  <!-- UUID: ad4fc5d1-ea5e-4270-9f8b-0a8f534598b8 -->

The subdocuments herein define contingencies related to Executive Votes.

##### A.1.10.1.4.1 - Executive Vote Cadence [Core]  <!-- UUID: de178e9a-b4b6-4103-82fc-e353aea89f2c -->

The Executive Vote occurs approximately every two weeks, although this cadence can vary based on decisions made by the Core Facilitator and the current spell team.

###### A.1.10.1.4.1.0.3.1 - Current Spell Team - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 2946ed2d-b027-4aea-a37b-b7c58dd75f56 -->

The element "current spell team" refers to the group of people who are presently working on a given spell. Members of the spell team may perform a crafter role or a reviewer role. The "current spell team" does not include the "spell roster", which latter is defined as the group of people from which spell team members for a given spell are selected.

##### A.1.10.1.4.2 - Postponement Of Executive Vote [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1b54a173-547e-4f6a-8e09-61b9ce73f506 -->

A scheduled Executive Vote can be postponed if deemed necessary by the Core Facilitator and the current spell team.

###### A.1.10.1.4.2.0.3.1 - Current Spell Team - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 5e035410-3bab-4434-aa57-975e746ed0e4 -->

The element "current spell team" refers to the group of people who are presently working on a given spell. Members of the spell team may perform a crafter role or a reviewer role. The "current spell team" does not include the "spell roster", which latter is defined as the group of people from which spell team members for a given spell are selected.

##### A.1.10.1.4.3 - Additional Executive Votes [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1e89af32-19c5-423d-be30-a1b2f7a98c1f -->

Additional Executive Votes outside the regular schedule may be introduced if deemed necessary by the Core Facilitator and the current spell team.

###### A.1.10.1.4.3.0.3.1 - Current Spell Team - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 95b3197a-0e14-4a9f-82b7-d3af39c58e34 -->

The element "current spell team" refers to the group of people who are presently working on a given spell. Members of the spell team may perform a crafter role or a reviewer role. The "current spell team" does not include the "spell roster", which latter is defined as the group of people from which spell team members for a given spell are selected.

##### A.1.10.1.4.4 - Decision To Not Publish Executive Vote [Core]  <!-- UUID: b0b1243a-5a27-4e04-8a4e-2098047f1ccd -->

If there are no substantive changes due to be made to the Sky Protocol, the Core Facilitator, in conjunction with the spell teams, may opt not to publish an Executive Vote. This decision should be announced and justified on the Sky Forum.

###### A.1.10.1.4.4.0.4.1 - Spell Teams - All Recognized Spell Teams Can Participate [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: ef10f4bb-fec7-4c43-b0c2-1c8429114db7 -->

The element "spell teams" indicates that the entire spell roster can participate in the decision described in the Target Document. The spell roster is defined as all spell team members authorized to perform spell crafting and spell reviewing services for Sky Core.

#### A.1.10.1.5 - Use Of Non-standard Weekly Poll [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4519de07-123d-4259-ae70-c825be8653dd -->

If a non-standard weekly poll ("Signal Request") has been proposed, it will also be put in the weekly poll.

To create a non-standard weekly poll requires an urgent and apparent reason from a timing perspective to justify it. It is important to note that a non-standard weekly poll cannot be used for long-term decisions and requires consensus from the Core Facilitator before it can be accepted and published.

#### A.1.10.1.6 - Core Facilitators’ Authority To Create Proposals [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2ef63f36-5550-420a-96ee-a99c09451afb -->

The Core Facilitator may create proposals using the Weekly Governance Cycle to enable them to fulfill their responsibilities.

##### A.1.10.1.6.1 - Core Facilitators' Role in Adding Housekeeping Items In Executive Votes [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0d0e2e1a-0502-4ee3-bc9d-8bd8ddde19ec -->

The Core Facilitator is authorized to add housekeeping items in an Executive Vote pursuant to the procedure defined in [A.1.10.1.6.1.2 - Process for Adding Housekeeping Item In Executive Vote](2d165c27-5daf-4a84-af8c-7c36f5de03d2). The Core Facilitator can propose housekeeping items of their own accord; or, they can do so in consultation with the spell teams. 

Where housekeeping items are proposed by the spell teams, the Core Facilitator must always conduct an independent assessment of the justification for, and security risks associated with, the housekeeping items. After the proposed housekeeping items have passed this independent assessment, the Core Facilitator may propose adding these items in an Executive Vote pursuant to the procedure defined in [A.1.10.1.6.1.2 - Process for Adding Housekeeping Item In Executive Vote](2d165c27-5daf-4a84-af8c-7c36f5de03d2).

###### A.1.10.1.6.1.1 - Definition Of Housekeeping Items [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7648bf12-d600-4e0d-807b-5eb18e8d0f4f -->

Housekeeping items are defined as maintenance and record-keeping actions necessary to the correct functionality of the Sky Protocol. Housekeeping items do not include actions that modify risk parameters or introduce new elements into the protocol. 

Examples of housekeeping items include, but are not limited to, (1) cleaning up technical debt, (2) updating the Chainlog, and (3) cancelling payment streams that are no longer used.

###### A.1.10.1.6.1.2 - Process for Adding Housekeeping Item In Executive Vote [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2d165c27-5daf-4a84-af8c-7c36f5de03d2 -->

Housekeeping items can be directly included in Executive Votes without a Governance Poll through the following process. The Core Facilitator must first create a post on the Sky Forum detailing the housekeeping items and the rationale for their inclusion. The Core Facilitator must request a confirmation of the technical accuracy of the housekeeping items from the technical Ecosystem Actor (or spell team) who is leading spell development for the pertinent Executive Vote. The Technical Ecosystem Actor (spell team) must reply to the Forum Post confirming the accuracy of the housekeeping item.

#### A.1.10.1.7 - Signal Requests [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1e4765f6-4889-4fd0-b02b-8c424c584914 -->

Signal Requests are only permitted when they are specifically triggered and required by the Atlas. In all other circumstances, they are prohibited.

#### A.1.10.1.0.3.1 - Operational Weekly Cycle - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: fa682e4f-eb5a-4af2-920d-3c1da51987d8 -->

Previously, the "Operational Weekly Cycle" was called simply the "Weekly Governance Cycle." With the introduction of the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle, it became necessary to divide the Weekly Governance Cycle into two (2) subtypes: the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle and the Operational Weekly Cycle. These two subtypes differ in terms of the permissioned parties authorized to trigger a proposal and the governance mechanisms involved. For instance, the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle implements edits to the Atlas via the mechanism of a Governance Poll only. The Operational Weekly Cycle can action changes to the Protocol that require Atlas edits, and generally requires both a Governance Poll and an Executive Vote.

### A.1.10.2 - Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle [Section]  <!-- UUID: 14e99d92-71fc-44d9-9dbf-933bce2e1b32 -->

This Section defines the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle which provides a predictable framework for weekly edits to the Atlas. The Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle is implemented via Governance Polls.

#### A.1.10.2.1 - Cycle Breakdown [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3aa3aa8a-0097-46a4-a89a-2db46f7cb2af -->

The subdocuments herein provide a breakdown of the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle.

##### A.1.10.2.1.1 - Proposals In General [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6c52610b-b9f0-49a3-8014-d1f51543dcdf -->

In the transition to Endgame, the Atlas can be edited through the submission of an Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal (also "Weekly Cycle Proposal" or "Proposal"). Multiple amendments to multiple components of the Atlas are allowed to be submitted in a single Weekly Cycle Proposal. A single Weekly Cycle Proposal may seek to remove multiple components of the Atlas. 

Atlas Edits must always adhere to the Spirit of the Atlas and remain within the bounds of Universal Alignment.

###### A.1.10.2.1.1.0.4.1 - In The Transition To Endgame - Immutable Documents Can Be Amended [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 8139e05f-dbe9-4324-ba87-53248d7ca1b5 -->

Currently, in the transition to Endgame, the Immutable Documents (Articles and Sections) can be amended pursuant to [A.1.10 - Weekly Governance Cycle](83edd4e1-692e-4566-a415-b8f272c33c5e) and [A.1.11 - Monthly Governance Cycle](7f2ba62c-9b3b-4df6-aa16-189a749cffa3). Once the Sky Ecosystem enters the Endgame State, the Immutable Documents of the Atlas will be forever locked down and cannot be changed.

##### A.1.10.2.1.2 - Origination Via Forum Post [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2891a392-d5ca-45a5-80ca-ad2afaf5baa1 -->

The Author of an Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal (also "Weekly Cycle Proposal" or "Proposal") must post the Proposal in the Sky Forum in the appropriate category and signal their intent to submit the Proposal to the Weekly Cycle.

##### A.1.10.2.1.3 - Triggering Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: cef09d74-efc6-45cc-a75b-1132dae9e743 -->

An Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal (also "Weekly Cycle Proposal" or "AEW Proposal") can proceed to a vote only if it is triggered by a Ranked Delegate whose AD Buffer contains at least the Triggering Threshold (see [A.1.5.3.4.2.1.1 - Triggering Threshold](2c2b201e-b95f-4852-8e76-6dfe4c3c6a4f)) at the time of triggering the Proposal. The Core Facilitator is responsible for confirming that these requirements are met.

A Ranked Delegate may trigger a Proposal they authored, provided they meet the Triggering Threshold. To trigger a Proposal, the Ranked Delegate must post a reply to the Author's Weekly Cycle Proposal on the Forum. The Ranked Delegate’s post should signal their intent to trigger the Weekly Cycle Proposal.

Where more than one Ranked Delegate posts an intention to trigger a Weekly Cycle Proposal, the first Ranked Delegate to post a reply to the Author’s Forum post shall be treated as the triggering Ranked Delegate.

If the Weekly Cycle Proposal is subsequently voted down, the triggering Ranked Delegate loses an amount of USDS from their AD Buffer equal to the Triggering Threshold.

###### A.1.10.2.1.3.0.4.1 - Ranked Delegate Loss Of Rank After Triggering Proposal Is Inconsequential [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: fa3e83ff-02ee-4e24-b88a-660585c6d8f4 -->

A Weekly Cycle Proposal is considered correctly triggered when the triggering Aligned Delegate is a Ranked Delegate with at least the Triggering Threshold in their AD Buffer at the time of triggering the Proposal. It is inconsequential if, after triggering the Proposal, the Ranked Delegate loses their Ranked Delegate rank.

###### A.1.10.2.1.3.0.4.1.1.1 - Ranked Delegate Triggers Proposal And Loses Ranked Delegate Rank Immediately Thereafter [Scenario]  <!-- UUID: 9079bf46-34b8-4ba5-a856-7f96f2093acb -->

**Description**:

Entity is a Ranked Delegate with at least the Triggering Threshold in their AD Buffer. Entity triggers a Weekly Cycle Proposal. Immediately thereafter, Entity loses their Ranked Delegate rank. The Core Facilitator continues to prepare a Governance Poll for the Proposal.

**Finding**:

Aligned as to Entity. Aligned as to the Core Facilitator.

**Additional Guidance**:

The fact that Entity lost their Ranked Delegate rank after triggering the Proposal is inconsequential. Entity satisfied the requirement of being a Ranked Delegate with at least the Triggering Threshold in their AD Buffer at the time of triggering the Proposal, and thus the Proposal was properly triggered. The Core Facilitator acted correctly to prepare a Governance Poll for the Proposal in accord with the process definition for the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle.

###### A.1.10.2.1.3.0.4.2 - Ranked Delegates Must Stake Their AD Buffer To Trigger Weekly Cycle Proposals [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: bba7fb85-c652-4af2-b7ff-0257532be488 -->

To deter spurious or misaligned proposals, Ranked Delegates must "stake" a portion of their AD Buffer to trigger a Proposal. A Ranked Delegate can trigger a Weekly Cycle Proposal only if their AD Buffer contains at least the Triggering Threshold at the time of triggering the Proposal. This "staking" requirement of an amount of USDS equal to the Triggering Threshold remains in effect until the triggered Proposal is fully resolved - that is, until either (1) the Proposal is rejected by the Core Facilitator for misalignment, or (2) a Sky Governance vote on the Proposal concludes in an approval or rejection. If the Proposal is voted down or rejected for misalignment, the RD will lose an amount of USDS from their AD Buffer equal to the Triggering Threshold.

###### A.1.10.2.1.3.0.4.2.1.1 - Delay In Payment To Ranked Delegate Triggering Proposal [Scenario]  <!-- UUID: 1ebcda5d-5a10-4e78-ba52-5772df38cc56 -->

**Description**:

Entity is a Ranked Delegate with at least the Triggering Threshold in their AD Buffer. Entity triggers a Weekly Cycle Proposal. Immediately thereafter, Entity loses their Ranked Delegate rank. Three days later, before the Proposal has been voted on, the Core Facilitator distributes compensation to other Aligned Delegates but does not distribute compensation to Entity.

**Finding**:

Aligned

**Additional Guidance**:

Paying out the AD Buffer would have led to Entity's AD Buffer dropping below the required Triggering Threshold while the Proposal was still unresolved. In this Scenario, the triggering AD cannot receive payout from the AD Buffer until the triggered Proposal is voted on and approved by Sky Governance. Assuming that the Proposal is approved, the Core Facilitator is authorized to disburse the entire contents of the AD Buffer to the triggering AD in the next AD compensation cycle. However, if the Proposal is rejected by the Core Facilitator for misalignment or voted down by Sky Governance, the triggering AD loses an amount of USDS from their AD Buffer equal to the Triggering Threshold.

#### A.1.10.2.2 - Preparation And Publication of Governance Poll [Core]  <!-- UUID: f7e857e0-9de6-47ee-8817-966cb46ac9d6 -->

An Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal should be posted to the Forum by Friday at 8:00 am UTC to ensure the Core Facilitator have sufficient time to prepare the needed polls for the following Monday.

Every Monday, the Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle is carried out via Governance Polls. The Core Facilitator must publish the set of Governance Polls to the community Github and the official Voting Portal.

The Polls run for three days. Successful polls trigger direct edits to the Atlas.

#### A.1.10.2.3 - Rejecting A Proposal For Misalignment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 94856ced-5c37-42e0-a756-0fa2ccd73180 -->

The Core Facilitator can reject an Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal if they deem it to be misaligned. If the Facilitator rejects an Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal for misalignment, the Ranked Delegate who triggered the poll loses their AD buffer.

##### A.1.10.2.3.0.4.1 - Unanimity Is Not Required To Block Proposal For Misalignment [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 824e78be-2c90-46e5-9fde-3ecd5d9d7665 -->

Unanimity is not required among the Core Facilitators to block an Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal for misalignment.

#### A.1.10.2.4 - Minimum Positive Participation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 863b3e56-76c5-4448-b2b0-3b5e2d26a3fa -->

Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals must have at least 480,000,000 SKY equivalents of Yes votes to be accepted.

#### A.1.10.2.5 - Reconciliation Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9f8be4ba-170e-44c3-887e-c577c7b9394f -->

If multiple Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals editing the same component of the Atlas are approved by voters in the same Governance Cycle, the Reconciliation Process documented herein must be followed.

##### A.1.10.2.5.1 - Language Disallowing Simultaneous Edits Not Allowed [Core]  <!-- UUID: aa76a7ea-daba-406b-af52-4fa8da2277d3 -->

Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals cannot include language that aims to prevent other Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals from editing the same component of the Atlas within the same Governance Cycle.

##### A.1.10.2.5.2 - Simultaneous Edit Reconciliation Process Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: edb3b979-b7b6-4728-9c26-cf768d8827ea -->

Where voters approve multiple Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals that seek to edit the same component or components of the Atlas within the same Governance Cycle, the process described below must be followed.

This process only applies to the specific components that are being simultaneously edited. Other amended components that do not have edits in simultaneous proposals may be merged, unless they are dependent on the component that does have simultaneous edits.

Where simultaneous edits are non-conflicting / logically compatible: the Core Facilitator will consolidate them into a single edit either by stitching them together in the affected component or by stringing one after the other as a new component. Any action taken by the Core Facilitator in this regard will be documented publicly and should be available for examination prior to the end date of the relevant polls.

Where simultaneous edits are conflicting / logically incompatible and cannot be coherently reconciled: it falls to voters to decide which of the conflicting Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals they wish to accept. If there are two conflicting Atlas Edit Weekly Proposals, a subsequent binary vote actioned via a single Reconciliation Process Poll is appropriate.

In the event there are more than two conflicting Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals, the Core Facilitator may choose a suitable polling method that allows voters to choose between multiple options. The difference between the conflicting amendments must be clearly presented so that voters can make an informed choice on their preferred option.

A Reconciliation Process Poll will take place during the Operational Weekly Cycle immediately following the closure of the originating polls. The Reconciliation Process Poll will last for three days.

## A.1.11 - Monthly Governance Cycle [Article]  <!-- UUID: 7f2ba62c-9b3b-4df6-aa16-189a749cffa3 -->

This Article regulates the Monthly Governance Cycle, which provides a predictable monthly framework by which Sky Governance decisions are made.

### A.1.11.1 - Calendar Exceptions [Section]  <!-- UUID: 6c0810e2-390d-4efb-8b31-f36a7f6e1a05 -->

Due to the multitude of cultural and religious holidays occurring in and around the month of December, there will be no Monthly Governance Cycle in the December of each year.

### A.1.11.2 - Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle [Section]  <!-- UUID: d2cbddd2-58ef-4311-a71d-d2c340364cb5 -->

This Section defines the Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle, which provides a predictable framework for monthly edits to the Atlas. The Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle is implemented via the Atlas Edit Proposal (AEP) framework. 

In the transition to Endgame, the Atlas can be edited through the submission of an AEP. Multiple amendments to multiple components of the Atlas are allowed to be submitted in a single AEP. A single AEP may seek to remove multiple components of the Atlas.

AEPs must always adhere to the Spirit of the Atlas and remain within the bounds of Universal Alignment.

#### A.1.11.2.1 - Cycle Breakdown [Core]  <!-- UUID: c3c4b7c8-0979-48f7-9ba8-9565d71334b6 -->

The subdocuments herein define infrastructure and processes for the Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle.

##### A.1.11.2.1.1 - Origination [Core]  <!-- UUID: e10e40b3-a942-411d-9646-129a5f3f984a -->

The author of an Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle proposal ("proposal", "Atlas Edit Proposal", "AEP", "Monthly Cycle Proposal", or "AEM Proposal") must post the proposal in the Sky Forum under the appropriate category.

##### A.1.11.2.1.2 - Triggering Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7bbfd3b1-99b5-4c60-9292-68d776e03886 -->

An Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle Proposal can proceed to verification by the Core Facilitator only if it is triggered by a Ranked Delegate whose AD Buffer contains at least the Triggering Threshold (see [A.1.5.3.4.2.1.1 - Triggering Threshold](2c2b201e-b95f-4852-8e76-6dfe4c3c6a4f)) at the time of triggering the Proposal. The Core Facilitator is responsible for confirming that these requirements are met.

A Ranked Delegate may trigger a Proposal they authored, provided they meet the Triggering Threshold. To trigger a Proposal, the Ranked Delegate must post a reply to the Author's Monthly Cycle Proposal on the Forum. The Ranked Delegate should indicate their intent to trigger the Monthly Cycle Proposal.

Where more than one Ranked Delegate posts an intention to trigger a Monthly Cycle Proposal, the first Ranked Delegate to post a reply to the Author’s Forum post shall be treated as the triggering Ranked Delegate.

If the Proposal is edited subsequent to being triggered, the Proposal must be triggered again before proceeding further in the Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle process.

If the Monthly Cycle Proposal is voted down, the triggering Ranked Delegate loses an amount of USDS from their AD Buffer equal to the Triggering Threshold.

##### A.1.11.2.1.3 - Core Facilitators’ Initial Verification [Core]  <!-- UUID: 05cf14c1-621a-4e86-bab6-0fcbdca12666 -->

After the Atlas Edit Proposal is triggered, the Core Facilitator must verify that the Atlas Edit Proposal follows the template specified in [A.1.11.2.3 - Atlas Edit Proposal Template](3af371ae-cc75-47c8-bd51-9446d68afea7).

The Core Facilitator must also verify that the AEP has been submitted to the Atlas Github repository with a Pull Request by the AEP Author. Alternatively, the AEP author can request the Core Facilitator to create the Pull Request for them. 

If the AEP is successfully verified, the Core Facilitator must

◦ Approve the AEP and assign it a formal #

◦ Update the Preamble to the AEP

◦ Merge the Pull Request

##### A.1.11.2.1.4 - Request for Comments [Core]  <!-- UUID: 45ced7a3-f362-43c8-a053-d4360d94260a -->

After the Atlas Edit Proposal is verified, a period of reviewing by the community and attendant redrafting begins. The minimum duration of this period is determined by the Feedback Period and the Frozen Period. 

The Feedback Period is the minimum amount of time within which the community can give feedback in response to an Atlas Edit Proposal before it can advance to Formal Submission. 

The Frozen Period is the minimum amount of time during which an Atlas Edit Proposal must remain unchanged before it can advance to Formal Submission. 

These periods can overlap.

##### A.1.11.2.1.5 - Fulfilled Feedback Period Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8c1f48d7-2393-4749-9599-fb6e98cdc155 -->

After the Atlas Edit Proposal has fulfilled the requirements for a community feedback period, it is ready for Formal Submission.

##### A.1.11.2.1.6 - Submitting To Formal Submission [Core]  <!-- UUID: ffd09668-6088-4331-b8ee-bf8557e767eb -->

When the Atlas Edit Proposal is ready for Formal Submission, the AEP Author submits their AEP to the Monthly Governance Cycle by posting a Forum comment that states "Formal Submission". This can only be done within the Formal Submission Window of a Monthly Governance Cycle. The Formal Submission Window is a two-day window that starts at 00:00 UTC on the first Monday of the Monthly Governance Cycle and lasts until 23:59 UTC on Tuesday the next day.

##### A.1.11.2.1.7 - Core Facilitators’ Review [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7ba721b9-73f4-4080-a076-f6d1ceb519b4 -->

The Core Facilitator is required to review all Atlas Edit Proposals (AEPs) submitted for Formal Submission to determine whether they are misaligned.

###### A.1.11.2.1.7.1 - Procedure For Blocking AEP For Misalignment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 51dc4c3b-94cf-4fbc-bff2-648250a1f1ce -->

An Atlas Edit Proposal can be blocked by the Core Facilitator for misalignment. Unanimity among the Core Facilitators is not required to block an AEP for misalignment. 

Where an AEP has been blocked for misalignment, the Core Facilitator must update the AEP status as "Rejected-Misaligned". 

Each Core Facilitator should issue a written advisory opinion containing their findings/reasoning either supporting or rejecting the blocking of the AEP.

###### A.1.11.2.1.7.2 - Resubmitting A Blocked AEP To A Future Monthly Cycle [Core]  <!-- UUID: 90932951-629d-449f-ae15-fd459b454da6 -->

An Atlas Edit Proposal that has been blocked for misalignment can be amended and re-submitted in a future Atlas Edit Monthly Governance Cycle.

###### A.1.11.2.1.7.2.0.4.1 - Amended - Blocked AEPs Cannot Be Re-Submitted In Original Form [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: 523bfc8f-2d8a-4364-8307-7f9a7a764fd6 -->

An AEP that was blocked for misalignment cannot be resubmitted in its original form; it must be edited before it can be formally submitted again to the Monthly Cycle.

###### A.1.11.2.1.7.3 - Update Status [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9949588a-dad2-4649-a071-ef9c46992895 -->

If an AEP has passed the Core Facilitators’ review, the Core Facilitator must update the status of the AEP to "Formal Submission."

##### A.1.11.2.1.8 - Proposal Enters Monthly Cycle [Core]  <!-- UUID: e00795ef-f741-4946-83f6-a9b3d52e44bc -->

Once an Atlas Edit Proposal has been formally submitted and has passed the Core Facilitators’ review, the AEP enters the Monthly Governance Cycle.

##### A.1.11.2.1.9 - Accepted / Rejected Status [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6402ac15-75b4-421b-8541-8221f3a2c2e5 -->

The Atlas Edit Proposal is voted on. If it passes, it is officially accepted and given the "Accepted" status. If not, the AEP is rejected and given the "Rejected" status.

#### A.1.11.2.2 - Atlas Edit Proposal Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 106bd569-4cea-4221-b8e7-a064a9b1c3a6 -->

The requirements for an Atlas Edit Proposal are defined in the subdocuments herein.

##### A.1.11.2.2.1 - Atlas Edit Proposal Parameters [Core]  <!-- UUID: 16e06904-4596-4755-9d18-7c25d9e6177b -->

Atlas Edit Proposals have the following parameters:

◦ Default Feedback Period: one (1) week

◦ Frozen Period: one (1) week

◦ Governance Cycle: Monthly

##### A.1.11.2.2.2 - Frozen Period Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: b9da67b6-4cc2-4bd9-b6ec-900cd855fa64 -->

The final version of an Atlas Edit Proposal must be posted on Sky Forum seven (7) days before Formal Submission, and cannot move into Formal Submission if it was changed within the last seven (7) days.

#### A.1.11.2.3 - Atlas Edit Proposal Template [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3af371ae-cc75-47c8-bd51-9446d68afea7 -->

All Atlas Edit Proposals must use the following template:

#### A.1.11.2.5 - Process Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8eea2827-4d10-4893-92d3-9083be7e9267 -->

The first Monday of each calendar month marks the beginning of the Monthly Governance Cycle.

Time is inclusive and based on UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and the Gregorian Calendar.

**First Wednesday after the first Monday of the month:**
◦ The Authors of Atlas Edit Proposals must formally submit their AEP before this Day.
◦ The Formal Submission must be done through a message on the Author’s Forum thread that contains the AEP.

**Week 1, Friday**
After reviewing the AEPs, the Core Facilitator must decide whether each submitted AEP warrants moving forward to a Ratification Poll.

**Week 2, Monday**
The Core Facilitator publish the set of Ratification Polls. The format of these is defined in [A.1.11.2.6 - Ratification Poll Requirements](13e6da57-ee8e-4593-90f2-698642b1c82f).

Ratification Polls are published to the community GitHub, submitted on-chain, and appear on the official Voting Portal.

**Week 4, Monday**
The Ratification Polls conclude, and each proposal or set of proposals is marked as either Accepted or Rejected by the Core Facilitator.

#### A.1.11.2.6 - Ratification Poll Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 13e6da57-ee8e-4593-90f2-698642b1c82f -->

Ratification Polls under the Atlas Edit Monthly Governance Cycle must meet these requirements:

- Duration: two (2) Weeks.

- Minimum Positive Participation: 240,000,000 SKY.

- Type: Binary Poll (yes/no/abstain).

Ratification Polls under the Atlas Edit Monthly Governance Cycle must contain:

- Links to a specific version of a single Atlas Edit Proposal within the official Atlas GitHub.

In order for a Ratification Poll to conclude successfully and the contained proposal(s) moved to Accepted status, triggering an edit of the Atlas, each of the following conditions must be true:

- Yes vote-weight must exceed No vote-weight when the poll closes.

- Yes vote-weight must exceed the Minimum Positive Participation value of 240,000,000 SKY when the poll closes.

##### A.1.11.2.6.1 - Revision of Minimum Positive Participation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 535570e7-8548-451f-87f0-edb699373978 -->

The Minimum Positive Participation value defined in [A.1.11.2.6 - Ratification Poll Requirements](13e6da57-ee8e-4593-90f2-698642b1c82f) may be modified via a successful Governance Poll under the Operational Weekly Governance Cycle.

If such a vote is successful, the new Minimum Positive Participation value will come into effect in the _following_ Monthly Governance Cycle. The Minimum Positive Participation value may not be changed for Ratification Polls that are in progress under any circumstances.

###### A.1.11.2.6.1.0.4.1 - In Progress - Change To Minimum Positive Participation Value Cannot Affect Polls That Have Already Begun [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: b1887e4a-c937-4597-9259-1109e106885d -->

"In progress" refers to the state of a Ratification Poll that has already started, where voting is currently taking place. The Target Document thus states that any changes to Minimum Positive Participation values cannot affect polls that have already begun.

#### A.1.11.2.7 - Reconciliation Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8fb17cf7-71bd-4248-9294-60c06ac5321f -->

If multiple Atlas Edit Proposals editing the same component of the Atlas are approved by voters in the same Monthly Governance Cycle, the Reconciliation Process documented herein must be followed.

##### A.1.11.2.7.1 - Language Disallowing Simultaneous Edits Not Allowed [Core]  <!-- UUID: 530fe959-2d16-4475-84ba-09a8ba3f66bb -->

Atlas Edit Proposals cannot include language that aims to prevent other Atlas Edit Proposals from editing the same component of the Atlas within the same Governance Cycle.

##### A.1.11.2.7.2 - Simultaneous Edit Reconciliation Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3a7e2781-c6c4-4b0d-86c4-1c94abf010fc -->

Where voters approve multiple Atlas Edit Proposals that seek to edit the same component or components of the Atlas within the same Governance Cycle, the process described below must be followed.

This process only applies to the specific components that are being simultaneously edited. Other amended components that do not have edits in simultaneous proposals may be merged, unless they are dependent on the component that does have simultaneous edits.

Where simultaneous edits are non-conflicting / logically compatible: the Core Facilitator will consolidate them into a single edit either by stitching them together in the affected component or by stringing one after the other as a new component. Any action taken by the Core Facilitator in this regard will be documented publicly and should be available for examination prior to the end date of the relevant ratification polls.

Where simultaneous edits are conflicting / logically incompatible and cannot be coherently reconciled: it falls to voters to decide which of the conflicting AEPs they wish to accept. If there are two conflicting AEPs, a subsequent binary vote is appropriate in the form of a Reconciliation Process Poll.

In the event there are more than two conflicting AEPs, the Core Facilitator may choose a suitable polling method that allows voters to choose between multiple options. The difference between the conflicting amendments must be clearly presented so that voters can make an informed choice on their preferred option.

A Reconciliation Process poll will take place during the Operational Weekly Cycle immediately following the closure of the ratification polls. The Reconciliation Process poll will last for three days.

#### A.1.11.2.0.4.1 - In The Transition To Endgame - Immutable Documents Can Be Amended [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: b1ffdef7-4472-4cc9-8be1-4896e3373761 -->

Currently, in the transition to Endgame, the Immutable Documents (Articles and Sections) can be amended pursuant to [A.1.10 - Weekly Governance Cycle](83edd4e1-692e-4566-a415-b8f272c33c5e) and [A.1.11 - Monthly Governance Cycle](7f2ba62c-9b3b-4df6-aa16-189a749cffa3). Once the Sky Ecosystem enters the Endgame State, the Immutable Documents of the Atlas will be forever locked down and cannot be changed.

## A.1.12 - Updating Active Data [Article]  <!-- UUID: 75e8fd51-a540-4c3a-aaa9-1a38502f89b2 -->

This Article regulates modifications to Active Data documents. Active Data documents can be directly modified by Facilitators or other recognized actors through processes that occur outside the standard Weekly Governance Cycle and Monthly Governance Cycle.

### A.1.12.1 - Updating Active Data [Section]  <!-- UUID: 39cd11f3-70fc-4a05-9cc0-fcb5efccaa11 -->

This Section defines the processes by which Active Data documents are updated.

#### A.1.12.1.1 - Overview [Core]  <!-- UUID: 918bfa13-3390-4524-bd9e-759089ea643e -->

Active Data documents must be maintained and frequently updated as part of the Sky Ecosystem’s routine operational tasks. See [A.1.2.2.2.17 - The Active Data Type](925ce2e3-c3a9-4774-a96c-cf77e024d37c).

Therefore, Active Data documents can be directly modified outside of the standard Weekly Governance Cycle and Monthly Governance Cycle. 

Each Active Data document has an Active Data Controller document associated with it, which latter defines two elements: 

1) the "Responsible Party", or the entity who is obligated to update the Active Data, and

2) the "Update Process", or the authorized process by which the Active Data is updated.

#### A.1.12.1.2 - Responsible Party [Core]  <!-- UUID: af17e4fd-3c1c-49b1-acc1-95811ddbe5ef -->

The Responsible Party is the entity responsible for updating the Active Data. The Responsible Party has the permissions and obligation to update the Active Data through the Update Process specified in the respective Active Data Controller Document.

Since the Responsible Party element is defined in an Active Data Controller Document, modification of that Responsible Party element is subject to a SKY vote pursuant to standard governance processes.

##### A.1.12.1.2.0.3.1 - Active Data Controller Document - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: d84b2bbf-adeb-4a1d-a220-0dcfbff91b1e -->

Active Data Controller Documents are Primary Documents that have Active Data Documents attached to them as Supporting Documents. Edits to Active Data Controller Documents are subject to a SKY vote pursuant to the standard governance processes. These processes include:

- Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle

- Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle

- Facilitators’ Bootstrapping Poll

- Operational Weekly Cycle

#### A.1.12.1.3 - Update Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9cc660e9-4ce5-4358-9195-5b4b82eb769d -->

The Active Data Update Process specified in any Active Data Controller document must conform to one of the processes defined in the subdocuments herein.

Since the Update Process element is defined in an Active Data Controller Document, modification of that Update Process element is subject to a SKY vote pursuant to standard governance processes.

##### A.1.12.1.3.1 - Direct Edit [Core]  <!-- UUID: ecce1a73-dac3-4fe5-a9d6-8b445bbc591a -->

Active Data with the "Direct Edit" Update Process may be edited pursuant to the following process.

The Responsible Party must post on the Sky Forum their proposed changes to the Active Data, using the appropriate category. If the Active Data document is located in the Sky Core Atlas, then the Core Facilitator must confirm that the Responsible Party has the authority to request a Direct Edit, and then modify the Atlas to reflect the Responsible Party’s proposed change. If the Active Data document is located in an Agent Artifact, then it is the Operational Facilitator for that Agent that must confirm the Responsible Party’s authority to request a Direct Edit and then modify the Atlas to reflect the proposed changes.

It is permissible for an Active Data Controller to specify unique requirements in addition to the general "Direct Edit" Update Process described above. These additional requirements, if any, must be specified directly in the Active Data Controller Document; this can be done through a reference or citation to the pertinent Atlas document containing the additional requirements. The additional requirements may supplement, but cannot conflict with, any aspect of the "Direct Edit" Update Process defined herein.

###### A.1.12.1.3.1.1 - Corrections By Core Facilitator [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1604506b-c56f-44a2-a429-d1d7a6aa5d1f -->

To correct a clear error, the Core Facilitator may directly update an Active Data document at any time. Prior to taking such action, the Core Facilitator should notify the respective Responsible Party charged with maintaining the Active Data document.

However, if the error or issue is not clearly evident, the Active Data document must be updated in accordance with the established procedure defined in [A.1.12.1.3.1 - Direct Edit](ecce1a73-dac3-4fe5-a9d6-8b445bbc591a).

###### A.1.12.1.3.1.1.0.4.1 - Clear Error [Action Tenet]  <!-- UUID: a8be1e67-802b-45c0-bf87-ea96073a5e71 -->

The Target Document grants Facilitators the authority to directly edit an Active Data document if it contains a mistake or inaccuracy that is obvious, unambiguous, and indisputable. The term "clear error" means that the mistake is apparent and does not require extensive debate or investigation to be recognized as such.

##### A.1.12.1.3.2 - Alignment Conserver Changes [Core]  <!-- UUID: cfbfb3a9-4e2f-4494-bac8-af298b608b06 -->

Active Data with the "Alignment Conserver Changes" Update Process pertains to the Core Facilitators’ maintenance of the Atlas’ official listing of some subset of Alignment Conservers. 

The triggers of such updates can include, but are not limited to, recognizing a new Alignment Conserver; offboarding an Alignment Conserver at the request of that Alignment Conserver; adding an Alignment Conserver to the list of ACs who have received a formal warning; or derecognizing an Alignment Conserver for misalignment.

The Core Facilitator can modify the pertinent Active Data documents to reflect such changes immediately; they are not required to create a post on Sky Forum.

##### A.1.12.1.3.0.3.1 - Active Data Controller Document - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 0a8d0081-2063-4f50-a085-b9c9c91d0e19 -->

Active Data Controller Documents are Primary Documents that have Active Data Documents attached to them as Supporting Documents. Edits to Active Data Controller Documents are subject to a SKY vote pursuant to the standard governance processes. These processes include:

- Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle

- Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle

- Facilitators’ Bootstrapping Poll

- Operational Weekly Cycle

## A.1.13 - Relationship Between Sky Core And Agents [Article]  <!-- UUID: d607a8e3-17e1-4aab-9e74-11af39767cc7 -->

This Article governs the relationship and balance of power between Sky Core (and the Sky Core Atlas) and all Agents (and their respective Agent Artifacts).

### A.1.13.1 - Agents And The Sky Atlas [Section]  <!-- UUID: 3722c147-b5f6-45ed-b462-de9d1cf5cd50 -->

The documents contained herein define the relationship between the Sky Atlas and Agents, including the pre-eminence of the Sky Core Atlas and how conflicts between the Sky Core Atlas and Agent Artifacts are identified, escalated, and resolved.

#### A.1.13.1.1 - Sky Atlas Jurisdiction [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2d5b0c0b-66ab-4546-b622-cd3ae1e39752 -->

The Sky Atlas is the overarching governance framework for the entire Sky ecosystem and comprises six (6) Scopes in total. The first five Scopes define ecosystem-wide rules and governance processes, while the final Scope contains all Agent Artifacts.

#### A.1.13.1.2 - Sky Core Atlas [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7cbb23c7-277d-4a43-9b37-2cf4a0561916 -->

The Governance Scope, Support Scope, Stability Scope, Protocol Scope and Accessibility Scope, together with the Preamble, are collectively referred to as the "Sky Core Atlas". These contain the foundational and supreme governance rules, principles, and processes that govern Sky at the highest level.

#### A.1.13.1.3 - Pre-Eminence Of The Sky Core Atlas [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0f55f573-4c25-4b9d-87c6-01d2f7f43eb6 -->

The first five (5) Scopes of the Sky Atlas, together with the Preamble, serve as the foundational governance ruleset for the entire Sky ecosystem. All Agent Artifacts in the sixth Scope are derived from the Sky Core Atlas and must remain fully consistent with same. Where a provision in an Agent Artifact conflicts with a provision in the [A.1.13.1.2 - Sky Core Atlas](7cbb23c7-277d-4a43-9b37-2cf4a0561916), the latter takes precedence and shall supersede the former to the extent of that conflict.

#### A.1.13.1.4 - Agent Artifacts and the Agent Scope [Core]  <!-- UUID: 178d80c7-832e-4b0c-b2f1-79b718f11e78 -->

The Agent Scope consists of all Agent-specific governance and operational documents, referred to as Agent Artifacts. Although Agent Artifacts are part of the Sky Atlas, they remain subordinate to the Sky Core Atlas. Any Agent Artifact provision that conflicts with the Sky Core Atlas is invalid to the extent of that conflict.

#### A.1.13.1.5 - Conflict Protocol Between Agent Artifacts And The Sky Core Atlas [Core]  <!-- UUID: ecb0b102-fe9a-41b0-9fab-ba229764fa2b -->

A SKY holder who believes that an Agent Artifact conflicts with the Sky Core Atlas may escalate their concern to Sky Core Facilitators via posting a "Notice of Potential Conflict" on the Sky Forum. Upon receipt of such notice, the protocol specified in the documents herein must be initiated.

##### A.1.13.1.5.1 - Sky Core Facilitator Review [Core]  <!-- UUID: 81e59b78-a355-4497-bd4f-72188376c021 -->

Once a Notice of Potential Conflict is posted on the Sky Forum, Sky Core Facilitators must review the merits of the claim. The Sky Core Facilitators have the discretion to conduct an investigation and collect more information as needed to assess the potential conflict.

##### A.1.13.1.5.2 - Sky Core Facilitator Determination [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5ab97ecc-bf4f-4511-af73-da307b9ff951 -->

Following their review of the Notice of Potential Conflict, the Sky Core Facilitators must issue a formal determination about whether a conflict exists. If the Sky Core Facilitators determine that a conflict exists, they must issue an "Intent to Suspend" notice relating to the particular part of the Agent Artifact they consider to be in conflict. If the Sky Core Facilitators determine that no conflict exists, they must post this determination and their reasoning in response to the Notice of Potential Conflict on the Sky Forum.

##### A.1.13.1.5.3 - Intent to Suspend Notice Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 011846e4-8cab-4423-ae19-5a68ed83625c -->

Once the Sky Core Facilitators issue an Intent to Suspend notice relating to the relevant conflicting portion of an Agent Artifact, the relevant Prime Agent or Prime Agent token holders have fourteen (14) days to amend or clarify the Artifact provision in question in order to ameliorate the conflict. Once the fourteen days elapse, the Sky Core Facilitators must determine whether the conflict continues to exist. If the Sky Core Facilitators determine that the conflict is not resolved, the relevant portion of the Agent Artifact is formally invalidated.

##### A.1.13.1.5.4 - Emergency Process For Misaligned Agent Artifacts [Core]  <!-- UUID: cd9b64bd-9a0c-41ed-b02c-5cc6bfb231d3 -->

In an emergency situation (see [A.1.8.1.1 - Definition Of Emergency Situations](5eafb29e-84a0-4a53-a798-3f958c880225)), Sky Core has the discretion to immediately suspend an Agent Artifact provision or function if it reasonably suspects that the Artifact is contributing towards a significant or system-level risk. Sky Core must act in good faith when exercising its discretion in emergency situations.

###### A.1.13.1.5.4.1 - Emergency Suspension Resolution Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4037c7a7-908d-4cd1-8020-0dd3db899c10 -->

If Sky Core immediately suspends a particular provision or function in an Agent Artifact, that provision or function will remain inactive until either the emergency situation is resolved or a formal review by Sky Core Facilitators concludes that there is no issue with the Agent Artifact.

###### A.1.13.1.5.4.2 - Emergency Suspension Review Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 584801d6-f1ac-4158-8633-f4e566ce0c09 -->

Any decision by Sky Core to use its emergency suspension discretion must be followed by a formal review process by Sky Core Facilitators as to the particular risks or issues with the Agent Artifact in question. The Sky Core Facilitators must ensure that this review process is timely and clearly communicated to the affected Prime Agent.

#### A.1.13.1.6 - Root Control [Core]  <!-- UUID: 37c79482-b6b3-4055-82ce-169d1da98022 -->

Sky Core retains, at all times, ultimate "root-level" authority over Agents via Executive Vote and can exercise it as necessary. While Sky Core may delegate certain interpretive duties and other functions to specialized bodies such as Executor Agents, ultimate root-level authority always resides with Sky Core.

##### A.1.13.1.6.1 - Sky Executive Vote Override [Core]  <!-- UUID: a9d8aa61-9046-4e34-beee-44a0310174bb -->

A Sky Executive Vote will override any Agent Artifact or decision by an Executor Agent if there is a determination by Sky Core that the Prime Agent or Executor Agent is acting misaligned, or if the Sky ecosystem's safety or solvency is at risk.

##### A.1.13.1.6.2 - No Removal Of Sky Core Root Control [Core]  <!-- UUID: a6996fe3-6018-4241-aae9-bca7eb0fefb5 -->

Agents may not take any governance action or enact any Agent Artifact edit that would have the effect of undermining the root control of Sky Core. Any attempt to do so represents significant misalignment.

##### A.1.13.1.6.3 - Root Control Alignment Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: e5b96bad-0b8d-4cac-afda-d1bd41d6bcb0 -->

Sky Core can only exercise root control over a particular Agent in a manner that is consistent with the Spirit of the Atlas. Any use of root control must be proportionate and limited.

#### A.1.13.1.7 - Fundamental Alignment Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: 26e6229d-4ee3-4dd1-a1b4-0fd45f1a45ff -->

No Agent is permitted to take any action that is misaligned with the Spirit of the Atlas see [A.1.1 - Spirit of the Atlas](86a93dab-2f12-4c3f-9285-bcc4520c851b).

### A.1.13.2 - Agent Artifacts [Section]  <!-- UUID: 84f1702d-1faf-42fb-a9f6-fbc197f40b9c -->

The documents contained herein detail the jurisdiction of Agent Artifacts, including the interaction between Artifacts, configuration requirements, and the specific functions and requirements of Executor Agent Artifacts.

#### A.1.13.2.1 - Jurisdiction Of Agent Artifacts [Core]  <!-- UUID: e22a06b2-018b-4acb-a928-681f4c3e682a -->

Subject to any relevant provisions in the Sky Core Atlas, Agents are governed by the provisions of their respective Agent Artifacts. Agent Artifacts define the Agent’s strategic vision and day-to-day operational logic, including, in the case of Prime Agents, specific parameters or operational instructions relevant to the Agents’ business activities. These Artifacts play a pivotal role in delineating the operational processes that must be carried out by the Executor Agents with whom Prime Agents partner.

#### A.1.13.2.2 - Interaction Of Agent Artifacts [Core]  <!-- UUID: afab0e51-9546-4eaf-94cc-00a460aa5efe -->

Agent Artifacts must not limit or constrain the effect or operation of other Agent Artifacts. Agents can freely experiment or pursue divergent governance and operational logic within their respective Artifacts, subject to the fundamental requirement that all Artifacts remain aligned with the Sky Core Atlas.

#### A.1.13.2.3 - Location Of Agent Artifacts [Core]  <!-- UUID: 32495169-340a-4969-bb4f-c72512a95e8b -->

All Agent Artifacts, including new Agent Artifacts, must be recorded and publicly documented in the Agent Scope of the Sky Atlas: see [A.6 - The Agent Scope](4a08ca6c-e652-49e4-9b79-4831b20e600a).

##### A.1.13.2.3.1 - Canonical Version Of Agent Artifacts [Core]  <!-- UUID: 371a6946-24ab-4bc8-b8d7-7a8e9ad92013 -->

While the text of Agent Artifacts may be copied and made accessible in other locations, the version of a given Agent Artifact publicly documented within the Agent Scope of the Sky Atlas must be treated as canonical. In the event of any discrepancies between the Agent Artifact recorded in the Sky Atlas and elsewhere, the version formally documented in the Sky Atlas shall prevail.

#### A.1.13.2.4 - Agent Artifact Primitives [Core]  <!-- UUID: a132233a-8ec0-44d5-b93a-3cff6ca49ad6 -->

All Agent Artifacts contain a set of configured Primitive Instances, as set out in the Sky Primitives Article in the Support Scope see [A.2.2 - Sky Primitives](fcde2604-a138-4c1b-9d9a-14895835c907).

##### A.1.13.2.4.1 - Agent Artifact Instance Configuration Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3d7f42a5-8c7d-44ed-9a85-2ab8e7cca2f5 -->

Agent Artifacts must have an Instance Configuration Document detailing the configuration of each Instance of a given Primitive. This Instance Configuration Document must define the Parameters of the particular Instance, the Operational Process for that Instance, and all relevant documents and data for that Instance.

###### A.1.13.2.4.1.1 - Support Scope Required Information [Core]  <!-- UUID: 54baff0b-5b40-4dce-ae6c-8a69d27dc70b -->

The Parameters of each Instance Configuration Document in an Agent Artifact must correspond to the required information specified in the Sky Primitives Article in the Support Scope see [A.2.2 - Sky Primitives](fcde2604-a138-4c1b-9d9a-14895835c907).

#### A.1.13.2.5 - Agent Artifact Omni Documents [Core]  <!-- UUID: d2c31de7-75a9-4b69-9fd8-ca974aea5fee -->

All Agent Artifacts contain Omni Documents. Omni Documents can be used to encode any operational or business logic that either spans multiple Sky Primitives, or relates to non-Sky Primitive infrastructure inherited from Sky Core or other activities unrelated to Sky Primitives.

##### A.1.13.2.5.1 - Required Omni Documents [Core]  <!-- UUID: b6e391fa-3265-4694-a835-3231049c2062 -->

While in general Omni Documents may have whatever content an Agent desires, certain Omni Documents are required for all Agent Artifacts as specified herein.

###### A.1.13.2.5.1.1 - Root Omni Document [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5875496e-f87d-4eea-b8f9-2b26be681389 -->

All Agent Artifacts must contain exactly one (1) Omni Document subtree. The head of this subtree is the Root Omni Document. All Omni Documents must be located in this subtree.

###### A.1.13.2.5.1.2 - Governance Information Unrelated To Root Edit Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: a689a844-5632-4d5e-b3dd-c345fde9dd27 -->

All Agent Artifacts must contain a `Governance Information Unrelated To Root Edit Primitive` document as a direct child of the Root Omni Document. This document and its subdocuments must define governance processes of the Agent unrelated to token holder voting, which latter is specified in the Root Edit Primitive.

###### A.1.13.2.5.1.2.1 - Sky Ecosystem Emergency Response [Core]  <!-- UUID: f9f1a5a5-4c79-4b91-ada6-b473c22e154f -->

All Agent Artifacts must contain a `Sky Ecosystem Emergency Response` document as a direct child of the `Governance Information Unrelated To Root Edit Primitive` document. This document and its subdocuments must specify the Agent’s emergency response protocol applicable in situations that impact the entire Sky Ecosystem.

###### A.1.13.2.5.1.2.2 - Agent Emergency Response [Core]  <!-- UUID: f04bd29a-a736-4663-9df8-e46e794d6a60 -->

All Agent Artifacts must contain an `Agent-Specific Emergency Response` document as a direct child of the `Governance Information Unrelated To Root Edit Primitive` document. This document and its subdocuments must specify the Agent’s emergency response protocol applicable in situations solely impacting the Agent, versus the broader Sky Ecosystem.

#### A.1.13.2.6 - Prime Agent Artifacts [Core]  <!-- UUID: 39dc8d4c-5ed3-4d77-8b37-848b7cb23009 -->

Each Prime Agent Artifact defines an Agent’s unique strategy, model, or method of operations, as well as specific parameters or operational instructions relevant to that Agent’s business activities. There are requirements and restrictions for Prime Agent Artifacts, particularly in terms of how they may be edited over time.

##### A.1.13.2.6.1 - Fundamental Artifact Edit Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: fd5f6ac6-767e-4908-b64c-f88025ce5f18 -->

All governance actions taken by a Prime Agent must be enacted through edits to their Agent Artifact.

#### A.1.13.2.7 - Artifact Edit Processes [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2be8d2f0-bf02-4aa1-ad37-afb7a811a3b8 -->

There are two mechanisms for Agents to edit their respective Agent Artifacts: Root Edits and Omni Documents.

##### A.1.13.2.7.1 - Root Edit Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: dcdc71b3-0afc-471d-8e7c-cb0b81ba34d9 -->

The Root Edit process allows Prime Agents to update their Agent Artifact as prescribed in the Root Edit Primitive, see: [A.2.2.5.2 - Root Edit Primitive](78488c6b-d77f-4344-b954-476e415a2c7d). The Root Edit Primitive enables Prime Agent token holders to hold a vote on a proposed Artifact update. If that vote is successful, the Prime Agent’s designated Executor Agent will modify the Prime Agent Artifact as directed.

##### A.1.13.2.7.2 - Omni Document Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 26ec6b08-8187-44b4-abb3-aee3868161a4 -->

An Omni Document is a general-purpose Artifact Document that can be used by a Prime Agent to encode any operational or business logic, data, or processes spanning multiple Primitives or relating to non-Sky Primitive infrastructure inherited from Sky Core or other activities unrelated to Sky Primitives. Where appropriate, Omni Documents’ data schema can mirror that of Sky Primitives, or it can be customized for particular use cases.

###### A.1.13.2.7.2.1 - Omni Document Procedural Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5db28264-320a-4293-8813-dccb0d19ce32 -->

An Executor Agent must not implement Omni Document logic where it requires a subjective judgment call or use of discretion. Accordingly, Omni Documents must set out clear, specific and deterministic instructions for updating the relevant Agent Artifact. In addition, all updates by Executor Agents to Agent Artifacts must be aligned with the Sky Core Atlas and the relevant Agent Artifact.

###### A.1.13.2.7.2.1.1 - Determining Whether Artifact Logic Is Sufficiently Specific [Core]  <!-- UUID: 49f808e6-f82d-4ac4-882f-9878fdb998f0 -->

An Executor Agent may not update a Prime Agent Artifact if the relevant logic requires a significant degree of discretion, such that reasonable people may differ on how to interpret and implement the action. If there is ambiguity as to whether an Agent Artifact authorizes an Executor Agent to directly update the Artifact, the Executor Agent must err on the side of not making any changes. In an ambiguous situation, the Agent must enact the change to the Artifact through a Root Edit process.

#### A.1.13.2.8 - Founder Access Artifact Edits [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7c750981-f9cd-492e-acb9-947eb9feb86a -->

At the early stage of a new Agent Artifact, before the Invocation and codification of the Prime Transformation or Executor Transformation Primitive, the Founder of a new Agent has greater discretion to create new Omni Documents and edit existing Omni Documents. Further details about "Founder Access" are located in the Support Scope see [A.2.2.1.1.3.2 - Founder Access](a4f65994-2526-4522-a986-cd444a5cb896).

##### A.1.13.2.8.1 - Founder Access Discretion [Core]  <!-- UUID: 85afc135-eb0d-4f17-8f8f-88ff13b8b6da -->

Prior to the Invocation and codification of the Prime Transformation or Executor Transformation Primitive within an Agent Artifact, the Agent’s Founder may unilaterally create new Omni Documents or edit existing Omni Documents.

##### A.1.13.2.8.2 - Prime Transformation / Executor Transformation Ends Period Of Discretion [Core]  <!-- UUID: 00ee44e4-9a2e-4dd8-a30b-eb4f2401b72a -->

Following the Invocation and codification of the Prime Transformation or Executor Transformation Primitive, the Agent’s Founder no longer has the discretion to unilaterally create new Omni Documents or edit existing Omni Documents. Instead, the Agent Artifact can only be updated or changed through existing Omni Documents or the governance process defined in the Root Edit Primitive.

#### A.1.13.2.9 - Executor Agent Artifacts [Core]  <!-- UUID: 45b3a9e8-56fe-4f22-a21a-54526f38763f -->

Unlike Prime Agent Artifacts, Executor Agent Artifacts are standardized and come with specific limitations regarding Sky Primitives Activation.

##### A.1.13.2.9.1 - Standardized Executor Agent Sky Primitives [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3be71f09-25a8-4a4b-9306-81d1007e9210 -->

The following Sky Primitives are available for Executor Agents to Activate: all Genesis Primitives (the Agent Creation Primitive, the Agent Token Primitive, the Prime Transformation Primitive and the Executor Transformation Primitive), Operational Primitives (the Executor Accord Primitive, the Root Edit Primitive and the Light Agent Primitive) and the Executor’s own version of the Upkeep Primitive.

##### A.1.13.2.9.2 - Role Of Executor Agent Artifacts [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1405d49c-8373-409e-a96b-e59f49e3aeb0 -->

Executor Agent Artifacts define each Agent’s approach to operationalizing the strategy of different Prime Agents, including risk-management and fees

#### A.1.13.2.10 - Agent Artifact Review By Core GovOps [Core]  <!-- UUID: d4bf73e7-2f9f-454c-8add-614dff784f78 -->

Agents are responsible for maintaining their Artifacts in accordance with the Sky Core Atlas. Core GovOps may review Agent Artifacts to determine whether this requirement has been met and assess penalties if not, as specified in the documents herein.

##### A.1.13.2.10.1 - Responsibility To Maintain Agent Artifact [Core]  <!-- UUID: 603b2914-30eb-4a32-bbdb-1416903428d4 -->

Each Agent is responsible for maintaining its Artifact such that the following requirements are met:
    
◦ the Artifact provides clear authorization for all actions taken by the Agent;    
◦ the Artifact accurately reflects the current state of the Agent and its operations;    
◦ the Artifact conforms to all specifications in the Sky Core Atlas, including, without limitation, the specifications for each of the Sky Primitives (see [A.2.3](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.2.2_Sky_Primitives/1b2f2ff0-8d73-8095-bb8f-ed052141f936%7C9e1f)); and    
◦ the Artifact is free of significant ambiguities or contradictions.
If the Agent has an Operational Executor Agent then this responsibility is shared by Operational GovOps and the Operational Facilitator.

##### A.1.13.2.10.2 - Review By Core GovOps [Core]  <!-- UUID: e0dd40ef-1d3b-4a00-9601-181ce80d3eef -->

The documents herein define the process for review of Agent Artifacts for their compliance with the requirements specified in [A.1.13.2.10.1 - Responsibility To Maintain Agent Artifact](603b2914-30eb-4a32-bbdb-1416903428d4).

###### A.1.13.2.10.2.1 - Core GovOps Initiatives Review Of Agent Artifact [Core]  <!-- UUID: ec953006-98f0-436d-8324-7b75cd84688c -->

This review may either be initiated by Core GovOps in response to an issue that has arisen or be conducted as part of a regular review process established by Core GovOps.

###### A.1.13.2.10.2.2 - Core GovOps Shares Initial Findings With Agent [Core]  <!-- UUID: ed93f083-0e23-460e-a2fb-1f53233a237f -->

If Core GovOps identifies deficiencies in an Agent Artifact relative to the requirements specified in [A.1.13.2.10.1 - Responsibility To Maintain Agent Artifact](603b2914-30eb-4a32-bbdb-1416903428d4), Core GovOps shares those findings with the Agent and its Operational Executor Agent, if applicable.

###### A.1.13.2.10.2.3 - Response By Agent [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5e737413-20a2-4fe3-8878-e7fb4706d238 -->

Core GovOps gives the Agent, and its Operational Executor Agent, if applicable, a reasonable opportunity to respond to the deficiencies identified.

###### A.1.13.2.10.2.4 - Publication Of Final Findings By Core GovOps [Core]  <!-- UUID: 453f04da-9fcc-4a49-bd3e-374908d60319 -->

Core GovOps considers the response of the Prime Agent and publishes a final set of findings to the Sky Forum under the category for the relevant Agent.

###### A.1.13.2.10.2.5 - Remediation By Agent [Core]  <!-- UUID: 87a0f80d-bf02-403e-997f-0793701bcaa9 -->

The Agent must submit a Root Edit Proposal to update its Artifact to address the deficiencies identified in the final set of findings (see [A.1.13.2.10.2.4 - Publication Of Final Findings By Core GovOps](453f04da-9fcc-4a49-bd3e-374908d60319)). If the Agent does not, Core GovOps may propose an Atlas Edit Proposal to directly modify the Agent Artifact to address the deficiencies.

###### A.1.13.2.10.2.6 - Appeals Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4fe3409f-468b-42d5-8ba1-cc03e4e1563d -->

If the Agent disagrees with the final set of findings of Core GovOps, the Core Facilitator resolves the dispute.

##### A.1.13.2.10.3 - Penalties [Core]  <!-- UUID: d195ee61-1afc-4cec-81b3-7514193bceaf -->

Penalties for an Agent failing to meet the requirements specified in [A.1.13.2.10.1 - Responsibility To Maintain Agent Artifact](603b2914-30eb-4a32-bbdb-1416903428d4) will be specified in a future iteration of the Atlas.

#### A.1.13.2.11 - Changes To Agent Artifact Specifications [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3458d1c7-d55b-4028-9ab6-fc02dc99a795 -->

Updates to the Sky Core Atlas may change the specifications for Agent Artifacts. The documents herein define how these changes in specifications are carried through to Agent Artifacts.

##### A.1.13.2.11.1 - Process For Carrying Out Changes [Core]  <!-- UUID: b1684804-9bd9-47a7-a080-d260609e023f -->

Updates to Agent Artifacts to conform to changes in specifications may either be carried out by each Agent (see [A.1.13.2.11.1.1 - Changes By Agents](8dbacc54-8a35-41a5-9337-f608fcea8b56)) or carried out directly by Core GovOps (see [A.1.13.2.11.1.2 - Changes By Core GovOps](dd76b3fb-6d99-43cf-92e4-b386c9141e25)). If Core GovOps chooses to directly carry out the changes, it must communicate this directly to the affected Agents before submitting an Atlas Edit Proposal. Otherwise the process for changes carried out by Agents applies.

###### A.1.13.2.11.1.1 - Changes By Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8dbacc54-8a35-41a5-9337-f608fcea8b56 -->

When Agents carry out changes in specifications themselves, each Agent must update their Agent Artifact through the appropriate governance process to conform to the new specifications.

Agents must carry out these changes within thirty (30) days of the change in specifications in the Atlas unless otherwise specified by Core GovOps.

###### A.1.13.2.11.1.2 - Changes By Core GovOps [Core]  <!-- UUID: dd76b3fb-6d99-43cf-92e4-b386c9141e25 -->

Alternatively, Core GovOps may submit an Atlas Edit Proposal to directly update each Agent Artifact to conform to the change in specifications. Such an edit may directly modify Agent Artifacts and is not subject to further approval by Agent token holders. Core GovOps should communicate the anticipated timing of this edit to all affected Agents as early as practicable.

### A.1.13.3 - Prime Agents [Section]  <!-- UUID: b9afc2bf-7697-4e21-820d-63dc8598f522 -->

The documents contained herein detail the specific role, requirements and capabilities of Prime Agents, including the operational delineation between Prime Agents and Executor Agents.

#### A.1.13.3.1 - Prime Agent Strategic Autonomy [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6a6c2870-3fa9-409d-a54c-952f61a30854 -->

Subject to the fundamental requirement to adhere to the Sky Core Atlas, Prime Agents have the autonomy to pursue a unique strategy, model, or method of operations, as defined in their Agent Artifact. Each Prime Agent’s unique Agent Artifact should also include specific parameters or operational instructions relevant to the Agents’ business activities. These Artifacts play a pivotal role in delineating the operational processes that must be carried out by the Executor Agents with whom Prime Agents partner.

#### A.1.13.3.2 - Prime Agent Executor Agent Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: cdf12e79-18f7-4b44-97ec-78290682005a -->

A fundamental requirement is that Prime Agents must partner with an Executor Agent. Prime Agents cannot be active without an active "Executor Accord" which codifies their relationship with an Executor Agent. Prime Agents may not amend their Artifact or make any other procedural change that would have the effect of removing the Executor Agent Requirement.

#### A.1.13.3.3 - Prime Agent Operational Autonomy [Core]  <!-- UUID: 946b8318-779c-4873-9413-6d44316f6d5e -->

Prime Agents autonomously handle initiatives that do not directly interface with Sky Protocol-level resources, including, but not limited to, the Sky Primitives. These activities could include product strategy and innovation, business development, partnership negotiations, and other business activities.

#### A.1.13.3.4 - Agent Role Delineation [Core]  <!-- UUID: fdf32ca5-5e2e-481e-9047-4d1599547216 -->

Whenever a Prime Agent’s strategy involves any on-chain or off-chain interaction with Sky Protocol resources or infrastructure, including the Sky Primitives, the operationalization of that strategy is generally restricted to Executor Agents. There is an exception for Prime Agents directly operationalizing Allocation System Primitive Instances using internal, proprietary strategies, see [A.2.2.9.1.1.3.1 - Operationalization Of Allocation Instances](989512c2-4fa1-46b8-947c-00e3c0b56024).

##### A.1.13.3.4.1 - Role Of Executor Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: bc07050a-4d28-4977-b46b-44bb52dea9ab -->

In situations requiring interaction with the Sky Protocol, Prime Agents themselves do not carry out the tasks needed to implement the relevant strategies. Instead, Prime Agents rely on Executor Agents to operationalize these processes, including bridging capital, verifying on-chain data and generating reports, and preparing off-chain votes for Prime Agent token holders to update their Artifact.

##### A.1.13.3.4.2 - Specificity Requirement For Prime Agent Artifacts [Core]  <!-- UUID: ca805edd-ec90-41c8-b9b0-7f76909c4a18 -->

To ensure clear direction for Executor Agents when executing Prime Agent strategies involving interaction with the Sky Protocol, Prime Agent Artifacts must include highly detailed and deterministic instructions. These instructions should allow Executor Agents to understand and implement the instructions without ambiguity or the use of discretion. More details about these processes and related logic can be found in the Agent Artifacts Section. More information about the role and function of Executor Agents can be found in the Executor Agents Section.

### A.1.13.4 - Executor Agents [Section]  <!-- UUID: 79a69869-3418-420a-8cba-032b808cb887 -->

The documents contained herein define the specific role, requirements and capabilities of Executor Agents.

#### A.1.13.4.1 - The Role Of Executor Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1b10829a-7b5d-4307-a1f1-916468abdfca -->

Executor Agents play a critical role in implementing Prime Agent strategies, as defined by their Executor Agent Accord with a particular Agent. Executor Agents are tasked with operationalizing Prime Agent strategies, and are able to directly update Agent Artifacts where sufficiently specific logic exists to do so.

#### A.1.13.4.2 - Requirement For Executor Agent Accord [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5dca36a5-a9aa-4c8a-9c41-b2be94c0e12c -->

Executor Agents must partner with Prime Agents through a formal Executor Agent Accord. An Executor Agent may not carry out any executive functions for a particular Prime Agent without a formal Executor Agent Accord.

#### A.1.13.4.3 - Adherence To An Executor Agent Accord [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8249a5d8-f7b1-4189-8901-ba4de330d031 -->

Executor Agents must adhere to all specific rules and requirements set out in a relevant Executor Agent Accord they agree with a Prime Agent.

#### A.1.13.4.4 - Ensuring Alignment With The Atlas [Core]  <!-- UUID: beb4109c-b425-42ef-afd6-9b52fe454268 -->

Executor Agents must always ensure that a Prime Agent’s actions or processes are fully aligned with the text and spirit of the Atlas.

##### A.1.13.4.4.1 - Executor Agent Alignment Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: b8cb6cf9-2904-49e8-b627-7907ba208adf -->

The requirement for Executor Agents to check every Prime Agent action or process for alignment with the Atlas is fundamental. It cannot be amended or altered by either Prime Agents or Executor Agents.

#### A.1.13.4.5 - Executor Agent Right Of Refusal [Core]  <!-- UUID: d20d3a11-0b46-4fb7-93dd-db473aa63665 -->

Executor Agents have the discretion to refuse to operationalize a Prime Agent’s update to their Agent Artifact, or any other action, if they consider that the action is either misaligned with the Atlas or presents significant risk beyond the Executor Agent’s insured capacity.

#### A.1.13.4.6 - Executor Agent GovOps And Facilitator Actors [Core]  <!-- UUID: a878427f-64a8-430f-8576-70b6e34ef419 -->

Through GovOps and Facilitator Actors, Executor Agents supervise other Agents and carry out operational activities on behalf of Prime Agents related to the Sky Primitives.

##### A.1.13.4.6.1 - Executor Agent GovOps And Facilitators [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6e4b1649-4d85-404e-a70d-ababba877d9e -->

Executor Agents act exclusively through their associated GovOps and Facilitator actors.

###### A.1.13.4.6.1.1 - Executor Agent GovOps [Core]  <!-- UUID: 76405733-3740-4c62-836f-c0683840a9a2 -->

GovOps actors carry out operational activities on behalf of Executor Agents and, by extension, Prime Agents that Executor Agents have entered into Executor Accords with. With the exception of specific activities reserved for Executor Agent Facilitators, all activities of Executor Agents are carried out by GovOps.

###### A.1.13.4.6.1.2 - Executor Agent Facilitators [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1b199df8-2bc3-4884-a60f-e45c3269fad4 -->

Executor Agent Facilitators are Facilitators that carry out specific activities on behalf of Executor Agents. Whenever an Executor Agent must interpret an Artifact, that interpretation must be done by the Facilitator. Whenever an Executor Agent has privileged access to smart contracts of Sky or an Agent, that access must be held by the Facilitator. Facilitators use this access to carry out the Executor Agent’s operational responsibilities as directed by GovOps, unless the Facilitator believes that GovOps is misaligned.

#### A.1.13.4.7 - Executor Agent Short-Term Transitionary Measures [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4fce0fd5-cfba-48b6-9af5-bbb0b5e917a6 -->

The documents herein define short term transitionary measures during the launch of Executor Agents.

##### A.1.13.4.7.1 - GovOps And Facilitators Acting As Executor Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2dc20bcf-08d7-4314-a2f2-aee9b41940e1 -->

In the short term, before the launch of Executor Agents, all references to Executor Agents in the Atlas refer to a GovOps Actor and a Facilitator, collectively. Sky Governance designates these actors as an Executor Agent on a transitional basis, and they have all the powers of Executor Agents as defined in the Atlas. When an Executor Agent enters into an Executor Accord during this transitionary period, it requires the mutual agreement of both the GovOps actor and the Facilitator, in addition to the Prime Agent.

##### A.1.13.4.7.2 - Transfer Of Budgets To Executor Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: 334c2821-23c2-46e9-b728-607608a8e933 -->

Shortly after the launch of Prime Agents, limited versions of Executor Agents will be launched. Budgets will be transferred to these Executor Agents from Sky Core so that, along with budgets transferred to Prime Agents, all Sky Core budgets are transferred to Agents. During this period GovOps and Facilitators will continue to operate as Executor Agents, with GovOps controlling the budget of the Executor Agent subject to review for alignment by the Facilitator.

##### A.1.13.4.7.3 - Full Launch Of Executor Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: fed006c3-75fb-47d9-a03a-a01ac0e57ccb -->

In the long term, Executor Agents will be fully launched with their own tokens and governance processes. At this point, GovOps actors and Facilitators will be contracted by Executor Agents through a vote of Executor Agent token holders.

### A.1.13.5 - Agent Termination Protocol [Section]  <!-- UUID: fe833d0e-8451-45e0-84a5-229d6ec964a8 -->

The documents contained herein set out the procedure for Agents who elect to enter a formal termination process.

#### A.1.13.5.1 - Initiation Of Agent Termination Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 023540ad-3b1b-429b-bfa7-9d740bf6ea77 -->

Initiation of the Agent Termination Protocol requires the token holders of an Agent to follow the special voting requirements prescribed in the Root Edit Primitive for the Agent’s termination. Typically, these special voting requirements include a supermajority (two-thirds of votes) in support of the decision to terminate, as well as a high minimum quorum (20% of all tokens must participate in the vote) and a lengthy voting period (two weeks) in order to provide the Agent’s token holders with sufficient notice. In addition, the Sky Core Facilitators must issue a notice in the Sky Forum publicizing the Agent’s proposed termination and subsequent vote.

#### A.1.13.5.2 - Execution of Agent Termination Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 28b90058-b29d-405d-a8e1-98fa133897cc -->

If the Agent Termination Protocol is activated, the Agent’s designated Executor Agent is tasked with ensuring the smooth and seamless wind-down of all of the Agent’s activities and functions. The Executor Agent must ensure that the cessation of any functionality is clearly communicated and signaled to users or other stakeholders, with a wind-down period calibrated to enable a smooth transition. Sky Core Facilitators must oversee the Agent Termination Process and ensure that the Executor Agent is executing the wind-down of the Prime Agent’s business activities in a manner aligned with Sky Core and end users’ interests. The Executor Agent should also, to the extent practicable, ensure that the assets or holdings of the Prime Agent are proportionately disbursed to Prime Agent token holders.

##### A.1.13.5.2.1 - Specific Termination Process Requirements For Executor Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: d28f48be-ba54-48cb-86f9-fffeb71de5ae -->

Where the Agent Termination Protocol is activated for Executor Agents, the smooth wind-down of the Executor Agent’s activities must ensure that any affected Prime Agents are able to continue their day-to-day operations without interruptions. Any suspension of Executor Agent activities and services must have a sufficiently elongated period of notice to allow Prime Agents and other stakeholders to obtain alternative support. An Executor Agent cannot conclude an Agent Termination Protocol until all supervision arrangements are transferred smoothly to other Executor Agents.

#### A.1.13.5.3 - End Of Agent Termination Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 52fb64c4-6ab3-45e9-a492-1d42926d93fc -->

Once the Executor Agent has ensured that all operational activities and functions of the Prime Agent have been wound down, the Sky Core Facilitators must issue a notice in the Sky Forum indicating the formal termination of the Agent. Any residual assets or holdings of the Prime Agents, that could not be disbursed to Prime Agent token holders, revert to ownership by Sky Core.

#### A.1.13.5.4 - Agent Termination Process Dispute Resolution [Core]  <!-- UUID: 065c176d-4a7e-4944-babb-43b325e33cf4 -->

In the event of any dispute between the Agent or Agent token holders, and the designated Executor Agent carrying out the Agent Termination Process, the Sky Core Facilitators must mediate. If there are operational disagreements between an Agent’s Founder or Agent token holders and the Executor Agent, the Sky Core Facilitators have discretion to direct the Executor Agent to take a particular action as consistent with the Sky Core Atlas and the relevant Agent Artifact.

## A.1.14 - Scope Bootstrapping [Article]  <!-- UUID: ba97b4dd-c4e0-4d12-8769-423f6ecdc6bf -->

This Article defines rules and procedures for swiftly resolving issues that may arise in the Governance Scope during the transition to the Endgame State. This Article must work to minimize transition costs and friction impeding this transition.

### A.1.14.1 - Scope Bootstrapping [Section]  <!-- UUID: 08dbb8ad-6481-41b4-b438-4b08425abefc -->

This Section defines bootstrapping measures that can override requirements and specifications in the Atlas. These bootstrapping measures are temporary.

#### A.1.14.1.1 - Multiple Conflicting Atlas Edit Proposals [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7c9fd35d-e6c2-4bcd-95bb-5b4d1b0de5f0 -->

When conflicting Atlas Edit Proposals are approved within a short period of each other, the Core Facilitator can decide to merge parts of the proposals together to ensure that the aggregate changes incorporate the best updates from each of the conflicting proposals.

##### NR-18 - Conflicting Atlas Edit Proposals [Needed Research]  <!-- UUID: ab868a43-3f89-4e9e-b281-6078e655e065 -->

**Content**:

This is an extensive Research Track. Some critical questions to be explored:

What criteria should be used to determine when two or more Atlas Edit Proposals are in conflict? Are conflicts strictly based on overlapping content, or do broader thematic or operational conflicts also count?

For instance: if two AEPs amend different sections of the Atlas but have implications that could lead to contradictory outcomes, how should the Core Facilitator identify and address this indirect conflict?

What if one AEP effects a significant overhaul of an Atlas document, while another effects minor tweaks to the same component? How do the Facilitators determine which elements of which AEP should take precedence?

If one AEP drew more support than the other, does this automatically mean the former is the best update? What if the former AEP was authored by an unknown author, while the second AEP was authored by a well-known community member with high reputation?

If merging proposals in this fashion becomes a common practice, what issues could arise? There is a risk of governance paralysis, where no significant progress can be made because of a loop of constant revisions and counter-revisions. Community fatigue could set in, where stakeholders become disengaged from the governance process due to the perception that decisions are never final. The continuous cycle of evaluating, merging, and discarding parts of conflicting AEPs is not only time-consuming but also increases the complexity of governance operations.

If the Core Facilitator merge parts of two approved, but conflicting AEPs, and the final merged product significantly deviates from the original intents of both, the representation of SKY voters' will becomes a compelling question.

#### A.1.14.1.2 - Governance Security & Ecosystem Actor Embedding [Core]  <!-- UUID: 12286b6c-0231-40e3-ab3f-234bc0249216 -->

As a temporary bootstrapping measure, incubating Ecosystem Actor Atlas Axis will be embedded in Core Facilitator-permissioned communication channels where Executive Vote-coordination work is performed. Atlas Axis will have no decision-making authority in the Executive Vote workstreams. The objective is solely to facilitate Atlas Axis’ preparation of comprehensive, robust and resilient Atlas data for Governance Security by enabling it to directly observe patterns and issues as they arise.

# A.2 - The Support Scope [Scope]  <!-- UUID: 1ce14bd8-c7b3-4f74-a152-292a8d8ebed0 -->

The Support Scope governs all routine aspects of ecosystem support, including governance process infrastructure and management, Agent support and Ecosystem Actor support.

## A.2.1 - Governance Process Support [Article]  <!-- UUID: f83a880f-6440-49ac-8e28-b16b4e2c9912 -->

The Support Scope regulates the routine governance processes needed to operationalize the Atlas. This Article defines key infrastructure and processes supporting this objective.

### A.2.1.1 - Governance Process Support [Section]  <!-- UUID: ef1ad0bf-069c-4199-8620-a508b34c2348 -->

The Support Scope must facilitate the routine governance processes of the Sky Ecosystem, pursuant to the principles and procedures defined herein.

#### A.2.1.1.1 - In General [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4b76256c-c625-49ce-a91d-88d3fbd2452f -->

Sky Governance deploys various core processes to implement its decision-making, including Aligned Delegate processes, the Weekly Governance Cycle, the Monthly Governance Cycle and the modification of Active Data. The Support Scope regulates routine governance processes based in the explicit rules of the Atlas. In contrast, the Governance Scope governs situations in which a document is appealed or is otherwise contentious for reasons of ambiguity or conflict with other documents.

##### A.2.1.1.1.0.3.1 - Ambiguity - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 62e031ef-de5a-4425-8561-439b6f72a548 -->

The element "ambiguity" refers to instances where the language of an Atlas document allows for multiple possible interpretations.

##### A.2.1.1.1.0.3.2 - Contentious - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 6691933f-0d3f-4a20-b609-57001a6a3491 -->

The element "contentious" describes a situation where there is disagreement or dispute regarding the interpretation, application, or validity of a document.

##### A.2.1.1.1.0.3.3 - Document Is Appealed - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: b5be838e-23a8-4ed4-b713-d5a57fe1864d -->

The element means that a formal request has been made to the Core Facilitator to review an Atlas document for potential conflicts with other documents or misalignment. See [A.1.2.3 - Conflict Resolution](e883ceb7-707d-4b1d-af3c-ed6f9aeac565).

#### A.2.1.1.2 - Coordination Of Scope Framework Processes [Core]  <!-- UUID: 53388cf1-7934-4048-a372-2aec5e5b8430 -->

The Scopes establish various specialized processes, including those for submitting governance proposals or modifying the Atlas. Core GovOps is responsible for monitoring and ensuring that these processes are executed in accordance with the established rules. An action carried out through a Scope-defined process is considered valid only if Core GovOps has been properly notified.

##### A.2.1.1.2.0.3.1 - Monitoring And Ensuring - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: f51addb2-fba3-476f-b3e4-1c5b4b9013fc -->

This element refers to the ongoing responsibility of Core GovOps to monitor the progress of routine governance processes, check for compliance with the rules, and confirm that all necessary documentation and approvals are in place.

##### A.2.1.1.2.0.3.2 - Properly Notified - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: df31f503-1238-4380-9a0e-25e2ef7c81d0 -->

This element means that Core GovOps have been informed in accordance with the prescribed procedures, including the timing, method, and content of the notification, as required by the relevant Scope.

#### A.2.1.1.3 - Designation Of Governance Process Support Ecosystem Actors [Core]  <!-- UUID: d537c3df-287c-45a5-aa69-2b4242b2259f -->

Core GovOps can designate Ecosystem Actors (including individuals, companies or Forum or Chat pseudonyms) as Governance Process Support Ecosystem Actors. This designation can include granting them moderation rights and other forms of administration rights on the relevant communication channels. 

Governance Process Support Ecosystem Actors can assist with governance processes including verifying Atlas Edit Proposals (AEPs), preparing and merging Pull Requests, updating the status of AEPs, preparing Polls, editing the Atlas, etc.

#### A.2.1.1.4 - Resources [Core]  <!-- UUID: 048600dc-3e21-4e1b-9e69-a0b5aff92ff8 -->

Core GovOps is granted a budget to procure the necessary administrative support and services from Governance Process Support Ecosystem Actors. The budget can only be used to perform tasks described in [A.2.1.1 - Governance Process Support](ef1ad0bf-069c-4199-8620-a508b34c2348) and its subdocuments. Core GovOps can modify the budget using an Operational Weekly Governance Cycle poll.

##### A.2.1.1.4.1 - Current Budget [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5efada66-f3d2-4e3e-b26c-123467069437 -->

The budget available to fund Governance Process Support tasks is 0 USDS per quarter.

## A.2.2 - Sky Primitives [Article]  <!-- UUID: fcde2604-a138-4c1b-9d9a-14895835c907 -->

This Article governs the Sky Primitives. A Sky Primitive is a standardized interface that allows Agents to connect to, and leverage, Sky Protocol’s permissioned infrastructure. This Article defines each of the Sky Primitives available for Prime Agents to use to expand the Sky Ecosystem. Each Prime Agent strategy is unique, so each may combine the Sky Primitives differently.

### A.2.2.1 - Primitives In General [Section]  <!-- UUID: df611e97-f99d-4244-8573-e706fbd1dfbc -->

The documents herein define general principles relating to Agent Artifact evolution, enumerate the currently available Sky Primitives, and prescribe the procedures by which Agents can activate, invoke and deploy the Primitives.

#### A.2.2.1.1 - Initial Stages Of Artifact Evolution [Core]  <!-- UUID: 73eb0d53-2746-4db8-8b61-608f7439d560 -->

The documents herein define the initial stages of the lifecycle of an Agent Artifact, beginning with the prerequisite of capital deployment and continuing until the Agent gains full operational status with an active Executor Accord and Root Edit Primitive. At that point, the Agent is interoperable with other Sky Agents and possesses a formal governance process by which token holders can guide its activities.

##### A.2.2.1.1.1 - Founder Deposits Capital And Pays Agent Creation Fee [Core]  <!-- UUID: 96ecd286-9361-4cb0-8062-9dd930780f3e -->

The prospective Agent founder kicks off the lifecycle of an Agent by deploying an initial minimum amount of capital and paying an Agent Creation fee in an off-chain process as defined in [A.2.2.3.1.1 - Capital Injection](bed7471a-54aa-4167-88dd-22ebd63f8827).

##### A.2.2.1.1.2 - Core GovOps Creates Scaffold Agent Artifact [Core]  <!-- UUID: b485d31f-e7e2-45fd-aefb-2a55206390a2 -->

After receiving the initial capital and Agent Creation fee, Core GovOps proceeds to set up a Scaffold Agent Artifact ("Scaffold Artifact"), which serves as a base template containing all Sky Primitives. In the Scaffold Artifact, the Global Activation Status of all Sky Primitives is initially set to `Inactive`. The sole exception is the Upkeep Rebate Primitive, whose Global Activation Status in the newly generated Scaffold Artifact is `Active` by default. See [A.2.2.1.2 - Primitive Global Activation Status](dde8cf4c-4823-4fea-96b8-a9b9d6b24533).

##### A.2.2.1.1.3 - Founder Inputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1b66ee09-3e81-4ae3-b3df-69787e0f662a -->

The documents herein specify the Agent Founder’s inputs following the creation of the Scaffold Artifact.

###### A.2.2.1.1.3.1 - Founder Required Primitive Activation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1a48e833-d960-4bdf-8f67-0f9d9307e00d -->

The Founder is responsible for Globally Activating the Agent Creation, Prime Transformation / Executor Transformation, Agent Token, Executor Accord, and Root Edit Primitives. Additionally, the Founder must Activate either the Distribution Requirement Primitive or the Market Cap Fee Primitive - or may choose to Activate both.

The Primitives named above must first be Globally Activated before the Founder can Invoke them to finalize Agent setup. The Founder may choose to Globally Activate these Primitives individually at different times or all at once; only the Primitive Invocation must be done in a specified order.

###### A.2.2.1.1.3.2 - Founder Access [Core]  <!-- UUID: a4f65994-2526-4522-a986-cd444a5cb896 -->

_"_Founder Access" gives the Founder of an Agent the ability to freely edit the Scaffold Artifact, including Activating any desired Primitives and adding custom Omni Documents. "Founder Access" is revoked at the moment the Founder Invokes either the Prime Transformation or Executor Transformation Primitive. From that point on, the Founder cannot add or edit Omni Documents, but can only Activate and Invoke specific Primitives so that the Agent can complete setup. See [A.2.2.1.2.4.1 - Agent Launch And Sequence of Primitive Global Activation](2f5ff5c8-bcd1-44a4-ba56-2075ac8e9c61).

###### A.2.2.1.1.3.2.1 - Short Term Suspension of “Founder Access” [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5dd07957-8e5b-4694-a0ba-a8aa88863552 -->

In the short term, "Founder Access" will not be operational. Instead, if a Prime Founder wishes to edit their Scaffold Artifact, they must use the customary Atlas Edit Proposal processes specified in the Sky Core Atlas at [A.1.10.2 - Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle](14e99d92-71fc-44d9-9dbf-933bce2e1b32) or [A.1.11.2 - Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle](d2cbddd2-58ef-4311-a71d-d2c340364cb5).

###### A.2.2.1.1.3.3 - Founder Invokes Agent Creation Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: d0b283e9-dac1-49c6-8dd7-b061c7a87335 -->

To proceed to the next stage, the Founder must Invoke the Agent Creation Primitive. From the Agent’s perspective, invoking, or calling, a Primitive always involves submitting required inputs into the respective Primitive itself. Here, the  Agent Founder must input the name of the Agent and an introduction providing a brief overview of the Agent’s vision or business model into the Agent Creation Primitive.

##### A.2.2.1.1.4 - Core GovOps Validates Agent Creation Primitive Inputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: 93d6147b-8760-431e-b38c-4a7afcb27e5f -->

Core GovOps validates the Founder’s inputs into the Agent Creation Primitive and the "Founder Access"-related edits to the Scaffold Artifact, ensuring that all information is well specified and that the Scaffold Artifact is aligned.

##### A.2.2.1.1.5 - Core GovOps Creates Genesis And SubProxy Accounts [Core]  <!-- UUID: 16d9dede-7fbf-4215-8e60-c06a8e6c3218 -->

After validating the Scaffold Artifact and Agent Creation Primitive inputs, Core GovOps creates a Genesis Account and SubProxy Account for the Agent. This data is automatically added to the Agent Creation Primitive.

##### A.2.2.1.1.6 - Founder Must Globally Activate Distribution Requirement And/Or Market Cap Fee Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: 94eacab6-0df2-45c6-89fe-af4f8c2e6263 -->

Prior to invoking the Prime Transformation or Executor Transformation Primitive, the Agent Founder must Globally Activate either the Distribution Requirement Primitive or the Market Cap Fee Primitive - or may choose to Activate both.

##### A.2.2.1.1.7 - Founder Invokes Prime / Executor Transformation Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2592b3d0-531e-42a3-a098-cf4b82bdd567 -->

When ready, the Founder Invokes the Prime Transformation or Executor Transformation Primitive to become either a Prime Agent or Executor Agent, respectively.

##### A.2.2.1.1.8 - Core GovOps Validates Transformation Primitive Inputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: 05e70418-5dbf-4d02-9d2a-9afea6619dd0 -->

Upon successful validation by Core GovOps, the Transformation Primitive is deployed and the Agent Artifact is upgraded to reflect that the Agent is either a Prime Agent or an Executor Agent.

##### A.2.2.1.1.9 - Post-Transformation Primitive Artifact Freeze [Core]  <!-- UUID: 20f4cfe0-1855-4942-ac0d-f5cb738e82fc -->

After the Transformation Primitive is successfully Invoked, the Agent’s "Founder Access" is revoked. The Founder can no longer freely edit the Agent Artifact, but may only Invoke certain Primitives in a specified order until the Agent setup is complete.

##### A.2.2.1.1.10 - Founder Invokes Agent Token Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: f5132655-afdd-4a93-adbe-64526759720c -->

The Founder next Invokes the Agent Token Primitive to create a token for the Agent that can be used to raise capital, build a community, and conduct governance processes.

##### A.2.2.1.1.11 - Core GovOps Validates Agent Token Primitive Inputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: 416dc0f2-fb0d-4ea2-975d-9bf2d9b0e1d4 -->

Core GovOps reviews the inputs to the Agent Token Primitive to ensure that they are well specified and aligned.

##### A.2.2.1.1.12 - Core GovOps Mints Tokens [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0e033de5-ce15-45df-ae85-9ed69bd40da0 -->

After validating the Agent Token Primitive inputs, Core GovOps proceeds to mint the Agent’s initial supply of tokens according to the instructions specified in the Primitive.

##### A.2.2.1.1.13 - Agent Invokes Executor Accord Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9b074b3d-73db-4a3a-9491-571021e4e61b -->

The Agent must reach an understanding with an Operational Executor Agent that will operationalize the Agent’s strategy. After doing so, the Agent records this understanding by invoking the Executor Accord Primitive. Note that this step is only applicable to Prime Agents.

##### A.2.2.1.1.14 - Core GovOps Validates Executor Accord Primitive Inputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: c1ff42c9-1ffc-46f0-9dac-da54eb4eb042 -->

CoreGovOps reviews the inputs to the Executor Accord Primitive to ensure that there is a valid Executor Accord with an Executor Agent and that the terms of the Executor Accord are reasonably specific. Upon successful validation, the Executor Accord Primitive is considered successfully Invoked and the Artifact is upgraded to include the Executor Accord. Now that the Agent has a documented relationship with an Executor Agent, Core GovOps will no longer perform validation of the Agent’s Primitive inputs. Instead, Operational GovOps associated with the Executor Agent specified in the Executor Accord will carry out certain operational tasks on behalf of the Prime Agent see [A.1.13.3.4 - Agent Role Delineation](fdf32ca5-5e2e-481e-9047-4d1599547216).

##### A.2.2.1.1.15 - Agent Invokes Root Edit Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: 63f85a1a-da2d-4828-ae32-da56f46d500d -->

The Agent Invokes the Root Edit Primitive and sets up a governance process for voting to occur.

##### A.2.2.1.1.16 - Operational GovOps Validates Root Edit Primitive Inputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: d5ee3f2c-cd2f-4428-974b-341e4cce7295 -->

Operational GovOps reviews the inputs to the Root Edit Primitive to ensure it specifies a process that they can operationalize and does not conflict with any of the requirements regarding the voting process set forth in the Sky Core Atlas.

Upon validation, the Root Edit Primitive is considered successfully Invoked, and the Artifact is upgraded with its functionality. At this point the Agent is fully operational. The Agent Artifact can only be edited through a token holder vote or, if applicable, by the Operational Executor Facilitator as authorized by Omni Documents. The Agent can Invoke and deploy any Primitives that it has previously Activated and can also Activate additional Primitives through a Root Edit.

#### A.2.2.1.2 - Primitive Global Activation Status [Core]  <!-- UUID: dde8cf4c-4823-4fea-96b8-a9b9d6b24533 -->

The documents herein define Primitive Global Activation Status.

##### A.2.2.1.2.1 - Primitives Must First Be Activated To Be Invoked [Core]  <!-- UUID: dcd0bead-7ad1-4fe0-b485-b3565d670c78 -->

An Agent may only Invoke a Primitive that it has previously Globally Activated; the process of Invocation is defined below at [A.2.2.1.3.3 - Changing Primitive Instance Status](263f3b28-9cd4-4ba2-b8e5-152c2ce0c050). In this way, an Agent’s decision regarding which Primitives to Activate allows the Agent to express its strategy to token holders. For example, an Agent that was focused on asset gathering might Globally Activate the Distribution Reward and Integration Boost Primitives, but not the Allocation System Primitive.

##### A.2.2.1.2.2 - Initial Primitive Global Activation Status [Core]  <!-- UUID: 377150b3-d64b-4436-ab6d-758b05d82f26 -->

Scaffold Artifacts by default include all Sky Primitives. To begin with, all Sky Primitives have the Global Activation Status of `Inactive`; the exception is the Upkeep Rebate Primitive, which comes Globally Activated in all Scaffold Artifacts.

##### A.2.2.1.2.3 - Primitive Activation Does Not Require Invocation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1560f392-db95-43d0-968b-af8d1afa4e84 -->

Activation gives the Agent the ability to Invoke a Primitive (thereby creating an instance of that Primitive), but does not require the Agent to do so.

##### A.2.2.1.2.4 - Changing A Primitive’s Global Activation Status [Core]  <!-- UUID: 51cfca28-c8de-457a-abc4-8ce1f64abb91 -->

An Agent can change the Global Activation Status of a Primitive as defined herein.

###### A.2.2.1.2.4.1 - Agent Launch And Sequence of Primitive Global Activation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2f5ff5c8-bcd1-44a4-ba56-2075ac8e9c61 -->

Sky Primitives can be Globally Activated (and their instances later Invoked) by an Agent at different points in the Artifact’s lifecycle. The process is divided into three main stages, outlined in the documents herein.

###### A.2.2.1.2.4.1.1 - “Pre Transformation Primitive” Stage [Core]  <!-- UUID: b5cbcb47-ff44-4809-8071-2b5f7b30efbb -->

After the Scaffold Artifact has been established, but before invoking the Prime Transformation or Executor Transformation Primitive, the Agent Founder retains unilateral authority ("Founder Access") to Activate any desired Primitives while freely editing the Agent Artifact. The Founder must Globally Activate either the Distribution Requirement Primitive or the Market Cap Fee Primitive - or may choose to Activate both. No Operational Executor Facilitator approval or token holder vote is required at this stage. See [A.2.2.1.1.3.2 - Founder Access](a4f65994-2526-4522-a986-cd444a5cb896).

###### A.2.2.1.2.4.1.2 - “Pre Root Edit Primitive” Stage [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7b25b220-92f9-4936-8296-31c0f3d8ddbc -->

After the Prime Transformation or Executor Transformation Primitive has been Invoked, but before the Root Edit Primitive is Invoked, the Agent Founder can no longer freely edit the Artifact. During this period, the Agent must Activate and Invoke (1) the Agent Token Primitive, then (2) the Executor Accord Primitive, and finally (3) the Root Edit Primitive, in that order, to complete its governance setup - assuming that these Primitives were not already Globally Activated during the "Pre Transformation Primitive" Stage. No other Primitives can be Globally Activated by the Agent during this period.

###### A.2.2.1.2.4.1.3 - “Post Root Edit Primitive” Stage [Core]  <!-- UUID: 857b85e5-b57e-4043-82eb-6fbb68cf1d51 -->

After the Root Edit Primitive is Invoked, changing the Global Activation Status of a Primitive - whether activating or deactivating - requires a token holder vote and review by the Operational Executor Facilitator.

###### A.2.2.1.2.4.2 - Global Primitive Deactivation [Core]  <!-- UUID: d0fb8761-2fcb-4d81-b498-38cd44f47fb0 -->

Generally, a Prime Agent may freely deactivate a Primitive’s Global Status pursuant to the governance process defined in its Root Edit Primitive. However, there are exceptions to this rule given the special functionality of certain Primitives. See [A.2.2.1.2.4.2.1 - Prohibition On Deactivating Certain Primitives](3ce3a1ae-9300-4159-9676-261d0404360f). 

If a Primitive’s Global Status is deactivated, _all_ existing instances of that Primitive immediately become `Suspended`. While the Primitive remains Globally Inactive, the Agent is barred from creating new instances or reactivating existing instances of that Primitive.

###### A.2.2.1.2.4.2.1 - Prohibition On Deactivating Certain Primitives [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3ce3a1ae-9300-4159-9676-261d0404360f -->

The documents herein specify the Sky Primitives that, once Globally Activated, cannot be deactivated.

###### A.2.2.1.2.4.2.1.1 - Prohibition On Deactivating Genesis Primitives [Core]  <!-- UUID: 04bbf091-b2a8-47e4-ad03-f3fd66e70279 -->

Once Activated, the Agent Creation, Prime / Executor Transformation, and Agent Token Primitives cannot be deactivated. These Primitives are deployed once, and thereafter their Global Status is `Completed` and cannot be altered.

###### A.2.2.1.2.4.2.1.2 - Prohibition On Deactivating Executor Accord And Root Edit Primitives [Core]  <!-- UUID: a4797404-1015-4cd5-a2ea-bc1a2699b575 -->

To maintain recognized operational status within the ecosystem, Agents must have active Executor Accord and Root Edit Primitives at all times. Once Globally Activated, these Primitives cannot be deactivated, as doing so renders the Agent unable to operate or make further changes to its Artifact. Should an Agent seek to wind down, rather than deactivating these Primitives, it must follow the approved termination process defined in [A.1.13.5 - Agent Termination Protocol](fe833d0e-8451-45e0-84a5-229d6ec964a8).

###### A.2.2.1.2.4.2.1.3 - Prohibition On Deactivating Upkeep Rebate Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: 85121142-aa54-4957-b0e1-8f4294512c7e -->

The Upkeep Rebate Primitive is by default Globally Activated in all Scaffold Agent Artifacts; it is not possible to deactivate it.

###### A.2.2.1.2.4.2.1.4 - Prohibition On Deactivating Both Distribution Requirement And Market Cap Fee Primitives [Core]  <!-- UUID: 984dcacc-d242-4203-90c2-d5cf61c92702 -->

An Agent must always have either the Distribution Requirement Primitive or the Market Cap Fee Primitive Globally Activated; it is not possible to deactivate both.

###### A.2.2.1.2.4.2.2 - Global Primitive Reactivation [Core]  <!-- UUID: cb452f09-007a-4000-a37f-46e8be48c066 -->

An Agent may reactivate a Globally Inactive Primitive according to the governance process defined in its Root Edit Primitive. Reactivating the Primitive restores the Agent’s ability to create new instances (via proper Invocation) but does _not_ automatically revive previously deactivated instances. Each existing instance remains inactive unless separately reactivated through the appropriate governance process.

#### A.2.2.1.3 - Primitive Instance Status [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4531962c-9847-40d6-b534-8a3a301703d0 -->

The documents herein define Primitive Instance Status.

##### A.2.2.1.3.1 - Primitive Instance Status Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: f507250e-8558-4692-914d-7760ea266a50 -->

Each valid Invocation of a Primitive causes the Agent Artifact to be updated with a specific instance of a Primitive. For example, each Invocation of the Token SkyLink Primitive launches a SkyLink deployment to a specific blockchain. The Agent may manage each Primitive instance independently (e.g., Activate or suspend it as circumstances change). A Primitive instance thus has its own Status or life cycle that is independent of the Primitive’s Global Activation Status.

##### A.2.2.1.3.2 - Instance Status Values [Core]  <!-- UUID: d3908a6c-a5b4-40d3-a982-89ad606a24d9 -->

The documents herein specify the potential values of the Status of an instance of a Primitive. An instance of a Primitive must always have exactly one of these values.

###### A.2.2.1.3.2.1 - Active Instance Status [Core]  <!-- UUID: dfd19e92-2660-4393-8dff-a3a7e4ad75ff -->

The instance Status of `Active` indicates that an instance of a Primitive is fully operational and may be used for its intended purpose by the Agent and potentially other parties. For example, a Token SkyLink deployment is active and can be used to bridge tokens between blockchains.

###### A.2.2.1.3.2.2 - Suspended Instance Status [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3e5de640-5bc2-4953-a233-913e3337b4bb -->

The instance Status of `Suspended` indicates that an instance of a Primitive was `Active` at one point in time and may be `Active` again, but is not currently operational. This may be due to the Primitive not meeting performance expectations (e.g. for an Allocation System instance), security issues, or due to failure of the Agent operating the Primitive to satisfy other requirements such as those specified in the Risk Capital or Asset Liability Management frameworks.

###### A.2.2.1.3.2.3 - Completed Instance Status [Core]  <!-- UUID: 82b88f94-b83a-432a-bb8e-4e726535156a -->

The instance Status of `Completed` indicates that an Instance of a Primitive has reached a terminal state and will not become `Active` again. This status applies in two cases: 1) a previously active Instance has permanently ceased operations; or 2) an Instance designed for a single Invocation has achieved its intended outcome and requires no further management (e.g., the one-time deployment of the Prime Transformation Primitive).

##### A.2.2.1.3.3 - Changing Primitive Instance Status [Core]  <!-- UUID: 263f3b28-9cd4-4ba2-b8e5-152c2ce0c050 -->

A Prime Agent that has a Globally Active Primitive may freely create (assuming the Primitive was properly Invoked), suspend, archive, or update individual instances of that Primitive, subject to the rules defined in the Agent Artifact and the Sky Core Atlas. For example, the Agent may run multiple Integration Boost instances in parallel (each with its own markets and configurations), toggling them on or off as needed, without affecting the underlying Integration Boost Primitive’s Global Activation Status. Changing a Primitive’s Instance-Level Status can be effected through the governance process defined in the Root Edit Primitive, or through an appropriately configured Omni Document. See [A.1.13.2.7.2 - Omni Document Process](26ec6b08-8187-44b4-abb3-aee3868161a4).

#### A.2.2.1.4 - Invocation of Primitive Instance [Core]  <!-- UUID: da763556-c316-431d-b57e-cc4df5a52fb8 -->

The documents herein define the process by which an Agent may Invoke instances of Sky Primitives. If the Invocation is valid, the Agent Artifact is upgraded and the Agent gains the Primitives’ specific functionality.

##### A.2.2.1.4.1 - Invocation Status [Core]  <!-- UUID: 83ac15ef-30e5-4958-95f4-a7bc2de10e97 -->

The documents herein define the Statuses assigned to an Invocation that is in progress.

##### A.2.2.1.4.2 - Required Inputs Into Sky Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: 316daff4-3260-45da-afde-eea3d357b9eb -->

To Invoke a Primitive, an Agent must supply all required inputs as defined in the Sky Core Atlas. Every Primitive instance abides by a standardized data model specified at the Sky Core level, ensuring that all Prime Agents, Executor Agents and other actors are able to submit and track the necessary data reliably.

###### A.2.2.1.4.2.1 - Required Inputs Submitted To Powerhouse [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3a8fe63b-a95d-4c6d-b8ae-48f4fe62e4c3 -->

The actual submission and handling of these data inputs occurs exclusively through the Powerhouse interface, which serves as the Sky ecosystem’s shared data infrastructure. Powerhouse thus becomes the canonical gateway for exchanging information with the Primitive, enforcing consistency in both the format of the data and the steps taken to Invoke (and later update) the Primitive.

##### A.2.2.1.4.3 - Validation of Primitive Inputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: c1e8985f-a21d-4264-b0e3-7cebee40e062 -->

Once the Agent has provided all required inputs to the relevant Primitive(s), the proposed Artifact Update undergoes review / validation by designated actors such as Operational Executor Facilitators. The identity and responsibilities of these actors are detailed in subsequent documents of this Article.

##### A.2.2.1.4.4 - Token Holder Vote [Core]  <!-- UUID: a06c8e7a-e20f-459a-99e3-a62a5c0c4fd1 -->

After the Primitive inputs have been validated, Agent token holders vote on whether to upgrade the Artifact with the Primitive(s).

##### A.2.2.1.4.5 - Formal Integration Of Primitives [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6948d758-ad79-47b8-8466-74c75ec9db9e -->

If the vote is successful, the Agent Artifact is officially upgraded with a Primitive Instance, which latter has its own independent Status that is distinct from the Primitive’s Global Activation Status. See [A.2.2.1.3 - Primitive Instance Status](4531962c-9847-40d6-b534-8a3a301703d0). This upgrade means that the respective Primitive(s) is formally integrated into the Agent’s Artifact and the Atlas as a whole; the Prime Agent can now operationalize the Primitive’s special functionality.

#### A.2.2.1.5 - Primitives [Core]  <!-- UUID: 947a5b27-d2dc-41e4-b6fd-696e35e2929d -->

The documents herein list the current Sky Primitives and set forth the process for amending them. Each Primitive is defined in more detail below.

##### A.2.2.1.5.1 - Current Primitives [Core]  <!-- UUID: 203b8c79-c7cf-4fcc-94e3-5bf42f791619 -->

The current Sky Primitives are:

   ◦ Core Governance Reward Primitive

##### A.2.2.1.5.2 - Amendments To Primitives [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1a46fd49-7b37-4a14-a311-eb1dbe947d85 -->

The set of available Sky Primitives may be amended in accordance with the governance processes established in the Sky Core Atlas.

### A.2.2.2 - Primitive Process Definition Schema [Section]  <!-- UUID: bdbb8ac9-d87e-4052-9e69-8267f38a54cf -->

Process Definitions function as the first-class objects through which Sky Primitives transform high-level governance logic into actionable document-driven workflows. All Sky Primitive Process Definitions are structured according to a common data schema - a set of fields that describe when they can start, how they run step by step, and what they must input or produce upon completion.

The documents herein define this data schema for Sky Primitive Process Definitions, which are applied to the universal specifications for each Sky Primitive. This common data schema aligns the entire ecosystem, while each Agent Artifact automatically references and extends the universal rules to incorporate the Agent’s unique Instance-level strategies, parameters and document-driven process flows.

At present, only the Distribution Reward Primitive and the Integration Boost Primitive specifications are structured using this schema. In future iterations of the Atlas, the schema will be applied to all Primitive specifications in this Article.

#### A.2.2.2.1 - Process Initiation Logic [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5df2043c-000a-4627-9c3a-2fdc12b78c47 -->

The documents herein define when a Process is triggered, and what conditions must be satisfied, if any, for the Process to properly initiate.

##### A.2.2.2.1.1 - Triggers [Core]  <!-- UUID: 134d8e80-6ec7-49fe-b7bb-6846694be11c -->

The presence of a Time-Based Trigger or Document Update Trigger for a given Process does not necessarily mean such Trigger is the sole means to initiate the Process. For example, an Atlas Document that is external to the Sky Primitives specifications may authorize a Facilitator to manually initiate a process.

###### A.2.2.2.1.1.1 - Time-Based Trigger [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1040dd2b-e7f8-4f68-b6c6-4b910f394a5a -->

This field defines the triggering date/time for recurring or scheduled Processes.

###### A.2.2.2.1.1.2 - Document Update Triggers [Core]  <!-- UUID: 16be342d-0584-4092-9943-97a8c4eeb672 -->

Document Update Triggers are a type of gating condition that automatically or deterministically compels initiation of a Process in response to a specific Core Atlas or Agent Artifact Document Update in a previous Process Definition.

Once the specified Atlas or Artifact Document Update occurs (and assuming any specified Dependencies are also met), the Process must be initiated.

If no such deterministic Document Update-based trigger exists for a Process to initiate, this field is set to "None."

##### A.2.2.2.1.2 - Dependencies [Core]  <!-- UUID: 64bec5dc-e288-4c8e-b638-c7180a92aca9 -->

Dependencies are gating conditions that must be satisfied for the Process to be able to proceed, regardless of a triggering event.

Examples of Dependencies include actors possessing suitable permissions, or a key stakeholder consenting to move forward.

If a trigger has occurred, but Dependencies are unmet, the Process cannot proceed.

#### A.2.2.2.2 - Process Flow [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6964c2d4-2994-487b-b68a-f1df5fa916f7 -->

This field describes the step-by-step operational procedure that occurs once a Process is properly initiated. A step can reference specific Core Atlas or Artifact Documents and broadly describe how their state is manipulated and decisions are made. More granular specifications regarding Document state changes are defined in the `Required Primitive Inputs` schema component [A.2.2.2.3 - Required Primitive Inputs](1474b30b-7e2b-4c9a-8624-3c2c5f53abc8). Process flow steps can both consume and produce relevant Document data.

#### A.2.2.2.3 - Required Primitive Inputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1474b30b-7e2b-4c9a-8624-3c2c5f53abc8 -->

This field specifies the Agent Artifact Documents and their associated fields that must be manipulated using the Powerhouse interface as part of a Process. If any of the required Inputs is missing or incorrect, the Process cannot be completed.

##### A.2.2.2.3.1 - Sequential Stages [Core]  <!-- UUID: e9422783-6196-4117-9099-b5ec0c338c05 -->

Some Processes require Primitive Inputs that are organized into multiple sequential stages (also called "Input stages"). Each Input stage must be completed before progressing to the next, ensuring that all dependencies and validations are met in order. Once an Input stage is completed, the subsequent Input stage is initiated automatically, continuing in this manner until all stages have been finished. 

Upon completing the final Primitive Input stage, the Process Definition transitions to the `Required Outputs` schema component; this component defines the necessary updates to Sky Core Atlas or Agent Artifact Documents.

###### A.2.2.2.3.1.1 - Required Output Trigger [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9c4f4cad-5124-44d8-b19e-bd931fae7963 -->

Where a Process Definition has more than one set of `Required Outputs`, with each set corresponding to (or "triggered by") a particular Input stage, the `Required Primitive Inputs` schema component must explicitly correlate each Input stage with the `Required Outputs` it triggers. See [A.2.2.2.4.1 - Multiple Required Outputs And Their Respective Input Stage or Mutually Exclusive Pathway](10c53693-4784-40ad-a8c6-fd2551f14280).

##### A.2.2.2.3.2 - Mutually Exclusive Pathways [Core]  <!-- UUID: 926cd44b-e26c-4ae9-9091-d97c362d7e29 -->

Some Processes require Primitive Inputs that are organized into two or more mutually exclusive pathways (also "mutually exclusive Input pathways"). Once a pathway is chosen—either manually or automatically via the application of a defined decision or condition—the Process follows that pathway through to completion, rendering the other pathways inapplicable.

###### A.2.2.2.3.2.1 - Required Output Trigger [Core]  <!-- UUID: a61d4797-9a1f-455c-8fe1-b62164e702b3 -->

When multiple "sets" of `Required Outputs` exist, with each set corresponding to (or "triggered by") a particular Mutually Exclusive Input Pathway, the `Required Primitive Inputs` schema component must explicitly correlate each Mutually Exclusive Input Pathway with the `Required Outputs` it triggers. Because the pathways are mutually exclusive, only the Required Output set associated with the selected Pathway will be executed. The other Output sets remain inactive.

#### A.2.2.2.4 - Required Outputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: dee40c3b-2f89-44c6-8813-c48888df08a7 -->

This field specifies the particular Sky Core Atlas and/or Agent Artifact Documents that must be updated as an end result of a Process.

Where applicable, a Document Update can serve as a "trigger" that deterministically compels another Process Definition to be initiated by a system or actor. The `Trigger - Process` field links to the respective Process Definition that is triggered by the Required Output.

Some processes do not need formal "Required Outputs" because the only process flow step is a simple update of an Artifact Document. In these edge cases, the change specified in `Required Primitive Inputs` (e.g., toggling a field to Globally Activate a Primitive) fully completes the process, effectively completing it in a single step. Once the designated Document and field are updated as prescribed, the Process is considered finalized.

##### A.2.2.2.4.1 - Multiple Required Outputs And Their Respective Input Stage or Mutually Exclusive Pathway [Core]  <!-- UUID: 10c53693-4784-40ad-a8c6-fd2551f14280 -->

Where a Process Definition has more than one set of Required Outputs, and each set corresponds to (or is "triggered by") either a specific Input stage or a specific Mutually Exclusive Input Pathway, the Process Definition’s `Required Primitive Input` field must define which `Required Output` set is Invoked upon completion of that stage or pathway.

1. **For Sequential Stages**
When multiple sequential stages exist, each stage’s successful completion triggers its corresponding Required Output set. As subsequent stages are completed in turn, each triggers its own distinct Required Outputs, ensuring that all designated outputs eventually execute in sequence.

2. **For Mutually Exclusive Pathways**
If the Required Primitive Input process instead (or additionally) involves mutually exclusive paths, once a pathway is chosen—either manually or automatically by a specified condition—only the Required Output set tied to that pathway is applied. Outputs associated with the unselected/unexecuted pathways remain inactive.

##### A.2.2.2.4.2 - Agent Artifact Document Specification [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3b3e537c-4989-4674-94bc-05928146ab42 -->

In the Sky Primitives Data Schema, references to an Agent Artifact Document are made in terms of the generic Document type. See [A.1.2.2.2 - List Of Document Types And Their Specifications](428b7f2e-30b0-4119-a10a-9c3496f19bd2). In practice, each Agent has its own Instance of that Document type in its Artifact. Thus, when a Primitive’s process flow indicates that an Agent Artifact Document must be updated, it is to be interpreted as referring to the _specific Instance_ of that Document type in the Prime Agent’s Artifact.

### A.2.2.3 - Prerequisites For Activating Agent Creation Primitive [Section]  <!-- UUID: 9204bcaf-cfec-4f49-a115-31fad73ebd62 -->

The Agent Creation Primitive is the first Sky Primitive that must be activated by prospective Agent founders. Because an Agent Artifact does not yet exist at this stage, the prerequisite requirements set forth herein must be met, including off-chain obligations and governance outputs. Only after satisfying these prerequisites does the Agent Creation Primitive become accessible to the prospective founder.

#### A.2.2.3.1 - Agent Inputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: df925d98-2e73-4b26-859b-33caa8865f0f -->

The prospective Agent founder must deploy the required startup capital and pay the Agent creation fee.

##### A.2.2.3.1.1 - Capital Injection [Core]  <!-- UUID: bed7471a-54aa-4167-88dd-22ebd63f8827 -->

The required capital and the process for deploying it will be specified in a future iteration of the Atlas.

##### A.2.2.3.1.2 - Creation Fee [Core]  <!-- UUID: 708ad6b6-8e4a-46b3-9848-523d00a57420 -->

The prospective founder must pay the required creation fee. The required fee and the process for paying it will be specified in a future iteration of the Atlas.

#### A.2.2.3.2 - Core GovOps Outputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: e1cef578-801c-4905-a88b-e9703b048d2a -->

After the prospective Agent founder deploys the required startup capital and pays the Agent creation fee, Core GovOps creates a Proto-Agent and sets up a Scaffold Agent Artifact.

##### A.2.2.3.2.1 - Proto-Agent Creation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1f577977-2f4c-41a0-a3ba-f09fc77b8d09 -->

Core GovOps creates a Proto-Agent with no specific functionality in the ecosystem.

##### A.2.2.3.2.2 - Scaffold Artifact Setup [Core]  <!-- UUID: f55fdc70-dfe4-4c52-9be4-10bf3a6dc990 -->

Core GovOps prepares a Scaffold Agent Artifact  ("Scaffold Artifact") containing all Sky Primitives. In the Scaffold Artifact, the Upkeep Rebate Primitive is globally activated by default. See [A.2.2.1.2.2 - Initial Primitive Global Activation Status](377150b3-d64b-4436-ab6d-758b05d82f26). All other Primitives are initially set to `Inactive`. The Scaffold Artifact also includes an initial set of Omni Documents that provide general information about the Agent and organize the various Sky Primitive Instance Configuration Documents. Core GovOps must add the Scaffold Artifact to the Atlas’ Agent Artifact Scope.

##### A.2.2.3.2.3 - Address Deploying Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: 39d1cae8-a070-47a2-b69b-96e0f4f6a080 -->

The address deploying the start-up capital is assigned `Founder Access` to the Scaffold Agent Artifact. See [A.2.2.1.1.3.2 - Founder Access](a4f65994-2526-4522-a986-cd444a5cb896).

### A.2.2.4 - Genesis Primitives [Section]  <!-- UUID: 3d5e3668-8333-4908-adcc-5784cfe7f6b5 -->

Genesis Primitives are a category of Primitives addressing different aspects of initial Agent setup—such as Agent creation, token launch and configuration, and transformation pathways.

#### A.2.2.4.1 - Agent Creation Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: 82b95f6d-4883-4f08-ac3a-9d8189013fbe -->

This Primitive may only be Invoked after the prospective Agent founder meets the prerequisites defined in [A.2.2.3 - Prerequisites For Activating Agent Creation Primitive](9204bcaf-cfec-4f49-a115-31fad73ebd62), resulting in the creation of a Proto-Agent. Invoking the Agent Creation Primitive allows the Proto-Agent to establish its identity by declaring its name, as well as articulate its intended vision, business model or ecosystem goals.

##### A.2.2.4.1.1 - Agent Creation Primitive Process Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 46e64020-f283-48a6-b327-75ea15927ee4 -->

The documents herein define the Process Definition for initial setup and ongoing management of an Instance of the Agent Creation Primitive.

###### A.2.2.4.1.1.1 - Agent Creation Instance Setup Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 754e1599-28d7-499a-b68f-e2155e87105a -->

The documents herein define the process for setting up an Instance of the Agent Creation Primitive.

###### A.2.2.4.1.1.1.1 - Founder Inputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: cfde405d-e7e1-48eb-b044-3e9514c0aa96 -->

The Founder uses the Powerhouse interface to input the Agent's name and an introduction outlining the Agent's vision.

###### A.2.2.4.1.1.1.2 - Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: d2b0f57b-1596-4355-9c63-aec6466cf316 -->

Core GovOps validates the Founder’s inputs. This includes verifying that all of the documents created by the Founder using Founder Access are well-specified, that the documents are Aligned, and that all necessary Primitives to complete setup have been Activated. The necessary Primitives are the Agent Creation, Prime/Executor Transformation, Agent Token, Executor Accord, and Root Edit Primitives. In addition, at least one of the Distribution Requirement or the Market Cap Fee Primitives must be Activated. (See [A.2.2.1.1.3.1 - Founder Required Primitive Activation](1a48e833-d960-4bdf-8f67-0f9d9307e00d).) After confirming these conditions, Core GovOps creates a Genesis Account and a SubProxy Account for the Agent.

###### A.2.2.4.1.1.1.3 - Official Update Of Artifact [Core]  <!-- UUID: c73a1815-b2dc-4cec-9ef4-ae6e6aabf633 -->

After successful validation, the Agent Creation Primitive is considered successfully Invoked, and the Agent Artifact is officially upgraded to reflect an Agent Creation Primitive Instance, with a Status of `Completed`.

###### A.2.2.4.1.1.2 - Agent Creation Instance Ongoing Management [Core]  <!-- UUID: b7238f7c-253d-4881-bbb8-10e3ca2d62ba -->

The documents herein define the process for the ongoing management of an Instance of the Agent Creation Primitive.

###### A.2.2.4.1.1.2.1 - Agent Creation Primitive Results In One-Time Creation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1ca2f5f3-1be7-4855-bbb7-49630e7e2ae6 -->

Because the Agent Creation Primitive is deployed solely to effect the one-time creation of the Agent, no further management process is needed post-deployment.

##### A.2.2.4.1.2 - Agent Creation Primitive Input Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7a7a2631-e5e2-4b63-8f2b-45ecaec7af2e -->

The documents herein define the required inputs for a valid Invocation of the Agent Creation Primitive. If any input is noncompliant or omitted, the Primitive will be invalidated.

###### A.2.2.4.1.2.1 - Global Activation Status [Core]  <!-- UUID: f9de4749-2bf4-4871-a5a8-6fb6849af7ad -->

The Agent Creation Primitive must be Globally Activated.

###### A.2.2.4.1.2.2 - Agent Name And Introduction [Core]  <!-- UUID: c7e7507e-4d57-4842-932c-88cf232a53a8 -->

The Agent Creation Primitive must specify the Agent’s Name and provide a brief overview of its vision or business model.

###### A.2.2.4.1.2.3 - Agent SubProxy Account [Core]  <!-- UUID: 585dc747-65f1-4443-b61b-9779031f9258 -->

The Agent Creation Primitive must specify the SubProxy address of the Agent. This field is populated by Core GovOps. The SubProxy is an account that serves as the Agent’s treasury. The SubProxy Account is controlled by Sky Governance.

###### A.2.2.4.1.2.4 - Agent Genesis Account [Core]  <!-- UUID: 761966db-e9db-41f8-a9fe-cf8b0c1a7d26 -->

The Agent Creation Primitive must designate the Genesis Account.  This field is populated by Core GovOps. The Genesis account initially controls 100% of the tokens of the Agent. The Genesis Account is initially controlled by the Agent Founder.

#### A.2.2.4.2 - Prime Transformation Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: 81411106-fd6d-4f9c-b3ae-7af7b5e62482 -->

Prior to Activating this Primitive, a Proto-Agent has been created, meaning it has not yet adopted any specialized role. Since a Proto-Agent cannot perform actions in the Sky Ecosystem, it must first transform into either a Prime Agent or Executor Agent to gain functionality. The Prime Transformation Primitive defined herein allows an Agent to transform into a Prime Agent, subject to certain conditions.

##### A.2.2.4.2.1 - Prime Transformation Primitive Process Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: ddfbb811-94f5-43bb-bf5e-a9bab2be046d -->

The documents herein define the Process Definition for initial setup and ongoing management of an Instance of the Prime Transformation Primitive.

###### A.2.2.4.2.1.1 - Prime Transformation Primitive Setup Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3f1824b6-5325-43ac-b3d5-151fb0f55dec -->

The documents herein define the process for setting up the Prime Transformation Primitive.

###### A.2.2.4.2.1.1.1 - Agent Inputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: aef13d1b-08d6-4c89-8858-65f8acbe4adc -->

The Proto-Agent must use the Powerhouse interface to input their desired Agent Type into the Primitive. For the Prime Transformation Primitive process, the Proto-Agent must specify ‘Prime Agent’ as their desired Agent Type.

###### A.2.2.4.2.1.1.2 - Validation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 43598845-989e-44fc-8cb4-c60b67fd1f28 -->

Core GovOps validates the Proto-Agent’s inputs, namely, the Agent Type.  Additionally, Core GovOps performs a further review to confirm that all the documents created by the Founder using Founder Access are well-specified, that the documents are Aligned, and that all necessary Primitives have been Activated. The necessary Primitives are the Agent Creation, Prime/Executor Transformation, Agent Token, Executor Accord, and Root Edit Primitives. In addition, at least one of the Distribution Requirement or the Market Cap Fee Primitives must be Activated. (See [A.2.2.1.1.3.1 - Founder Required Primitive Activation](1a48e833-d960-4bdf-8f67-0f9d9307e00d).)

###### A.2.2.4.2.1.1.3 - Official Update Of Artifact [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2182141b-a2bc-46bc-b9a6-2cb62e55b302 -->

After successful validation, the Prime Transformation Primitive is considered successfully Invoked, and the Agent Artifact is officially upgraded to reflect a Prime Transformation Primitive Instance, with a Status of `Completed`.

###### A.2.2.4.2.1.2 - Prime Transformation Primitive Ongoing Management [Core]  <!-- UUID: c1cae3bb-283e-44bf-9860-b721a1625bae -->

The documents herein define the process for the ongoing management of an Instance of the Prime Transformation Primitive.

###### A.2.2.4.2.1.2.1 - Prime Transformation Primitive Results In One-Time Creation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 248bfb90-8bd8-410a-86d3-527e355eca43 -->

Because the Prime Transformation Primitive is deployed solely to effect the one-time transformation of the Proto-Agent, no further management process is needed post-deployment.

##### A.2.2.4.2.2 - Prime Transformation Primitive Input Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 062b9275-9778-4f24-b0e5-bccf9129c179 -->

The documents herein define the required inputs for a valid Invocation of the Prime Transformation Primitive.  If any input is noncompliant or omitted, the Primitive will be invalidated.

Instead, if a Prime Agent wishes to edit its Agent Artifact, it must use the customary Atlas Edit Proposal processes specified in the Sky Core Atlas at [A.1.10.2 - Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle](14e99d92-71fc-44d9-9dbf-933bce2e1b32) or [A.1.11.2 - Atlas Edit Monthly Cycle](d2cbddd2-58ef-4311-a71d-d2c340364cb5). The process for Prime Agents to use the Atlas Edit Proposal process is further specified in [A.2.2.5.2.3.2 - Atlas Edit Proposal Process For Prime Agents](364e52eb-4529-46a9-9852-edaaab88baeb).

###### A.2.2.5.2.3.1.1 - Publicly Held Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: d6265f88-d2d0-457b-8958-a3c22f9a5718 -->

The tokens of a Prime Agent shall be deemed Publicly Held if they are held by at least 2,000 Public Holders who collectively own 10% or more of the Prime Agent’s portion of its genesis supply, as defined in [A.2.2.4.4.2.4 - Agent Token Genesis Supply](ed342c6e-15ae-4c95-ad4e-4702c27eba62).

Public Holders are unique wallet addresses, excluding any address reasonably believed to be controlled by the Prime Agent, its core contributors, or their affiliates. An entity is affiliated with another if it directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such other entity.

To qualify as a Public Holder, tokens owned by a wallet address must not be subject to any contractual, legal, or technical transfer restrictions, including:

(a) time-based vesting or lock-up schedules;
(b) contractual resale limitations (including any limitations imposed by token purchase agreements, SAFTs, or other similar instruments); or
(c) smart contract restrictions that prevent transfer without further governance action.

Tokens held in liquidity pools or staking contracts shall be attributed to the beneficial owners of the deposited tokens, rather than to the pool or contract itself, for purposes of determining both the number of Public Holders and their collective ownership.

The Core Executor Agents are responsible for determining whether the tokens of a Prime Agent are Publicly Held. If the Core Executor Agents believe that a Prime Agent’s tokens are sufficiently decentralized despite failing to meet the technical criteria specified herein, they may conduct a Governance Poll to determine whether the Prime Agent’s tokens should be deemed Publicly Held.

The value of the distributed tokens is calculated as the number of tokens distributed, multiplied by the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of the token over the 24-hour period ending at 23:59 UTC on the last day of each month, immediately preceding the distribution event. This value is applied in the rebate calculation under the Upkeep Rebate Primitive. See [A.2.2.6.3 - Upkeep Rebate Primitive](569e1c2b-0e69-43e7-8491-06cc5f7d2988).

#### A.2.2.6.2 - Market Cap Fee Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: a21616f4-1611-4e0b-87b2-efbdff9f6f28 -->

The Market Cap Fee Primitive requires Prime Agents to pay an annual fee equivalent to 0.30% of their market capitalization to Sky, accounted for monthly. The annual fee of 0.30% of the market capitalization is divided into twelve (12) equal monthly payments, equating to 0.025% of the market capitalization per month. Payments must occur on the first day of each month, with the fee transferred to an address designated by Sky Core in [A.2.2.6.2.1 - Sky Core-Designated Address](2a5f0e38-e51a-4a68-a4b8-1a912b8bb12e).

##### A.2.2.6.2.2 - Valuation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4b856873-8c6a-449a-8ca6-487d8fed9029 -->

The market capitalization is determined as the total token supply multiplied by the TWAP of the token over the 24-hour period ending at 23:59 UTC on the last day of each month, immediately preceding the payment event. This value is applied in the rebate calculation under the Upkeep Rebate Primitive. See [A.2.2.6.3 - Upkeep Rebate Primitive](569e1c2b-0e69-43e7-8491-06cc5f7d2988).

#### A.2.2.6.3 - Upkeep Rebate Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: 569e1c2b-0e69-43e7-8491-06cc5f7d2988 -->

The Upkeep Rebate Primitive allows a Prime Agent ("Holding Agent") to claim a rebate on its Ecosystem Upkeep Fees when it holds any portion of the token supply of another Prime Agent ("Issuing Agent").

Ecosystem Upkeep Fees are accounted on a monthly basis. The Upkeep Rebate is calculated on the same cadence per Holding Agent as follows:

(1) The Holding Agent’s share of the Issuing Agent’s token supply at the time the Issuing Agent pays its Ecosystem Upkeep Fees, multiplied by
(2) The total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fees paid by the Issuing Agent. For a Prime Agent deploying the Distribution Requirement Primitive, the value of its total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fee is calculated pursuant to [A.2.2.6.1.2 - Calculation of Distributed Tokens](ef26607b-9635-4d42-a2cf-6c755f53883a). For a Prime Agent deploying the Market Cap Fee Primitive, the value of its total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fee is calculated pursuant to  [A.2.2.6.2.2 - Valuation](4b856873-8c6a-449a-8ca6-487d8fed9029).

This resulting rebate amount is applied against the Holding Agent’s Ecosystem Upkeep Fees due in the calendar month immediately following the Issuing Agent’s payment.

The Distribution Reward is calculated and distributed on a monthly basis.

###### A.2.2.8.1.2.1.4.2 - Reward Payment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 38cb0bfe-3733-4a11-8b3a-6728df00d08e -->

The Distribution Reward payment for each month is equal to 

(1) the average balance over the month, times 
(2) the annual Distribution Reward Fee specified in [A.2.2.8.1.2.1.3 - Distribution Reward Rate](57384c49-e499-4c69-b22c-8e1f1dd34759), divided by 
(3) twelve (12).

###### A.2.2.8.1.2.1.4.3 - Treasury Management [Core]  <!-- UUID: 935b90bb-a854-4c06-b6ea-48a1cf8fd2f1 -->

In the near term, Amatsu calculates the Distribution Reward on behalf of the Support Facilitators. The Accessibility Facilitators then pay the Distribution Reward from the Distribution Reward Controller Wallet located on the Ethereum Mainnet at `0x05F471262d15EECA4059DadE070e5BEd509a4e73` within seven (7) days of the end of every month. The balance of this wallet may be topped up to 3 million USDS. This funding is subject to an Executive Vote.

###### A.2.2.8.1.2.1.4.3.2 - Long Term Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 07953e87-c201-4ad5-9c1e-b32efc5fba94 -->

In the long term, Operational GovOps calculates the Distribution Reward for each month. Operational GovOps then pays the Distribution Reward recipient from its Buffer. Later Sky Core reimburses the Operational Agent Buffer for the amount paid as part of the Settlement Cycle. This minimizes the role of Sky Core in Distribution Reward payments and emphasizes the primary role of the Operational Executor Agent, acting through Operational GovOps, in implementing the Sky Primitives. The process is specified in further detail in [A.2.2.8.1.2.4.1 - Routine Protocol](c2abdd22-fe0f-489e-b281-450e066db701).

Multiple instances of the Integration Boost Primitive are allowed. Each instance corresponds to an Integration Boost program.

###### A.2.2.8.2.1.3 - Multi-Instance Coordinator Document [Core]  <!-- UUID: 71c3bf8e-9c5c-447d-afb8-d6ca66acf45f -->

An Agent Artifact that has more than one active instance of the Integration Boost Primitive is not required to have a `Multi-Instance Coordinator Document`, since each Instance can be managed independently.

##### A.2.2.8.2.2 - Global Specification [Core]  <!-- UUID: eecfa6ad-3419-411e-b25a-1ccde2d6484b -->

The requirements herein apply universally across all possible deployments of the Integration Boost Primitive by Prime Agents. They include the steps that Agents must take to deploy the Primitive, including Global Activation of the Primitive, Instance Invocation, and ongoing management of the Primitive Instance(s).

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1 - Base Elements [Core]  <!-- UUID: c398b383-3752-4534-aec6-4cd8e7292119 -->

The documents herein define the base elements of the Integration Boost Primitive.

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.1 - Integration Boost Partners [Core]  <!-- UUID: 31cb3b86-0125-4a04-996f-634b75b6cea2 -->

The Integration Boost is provided to DeFi protocol partners that allow users to deposit USDS balances. Sky makes payments to Integration Boost partners equal to the Sky Savings Rate times the Unrewarded USDS balances in their protocol. The expectation is that the Integration Boost Partner will pass these Integration Boost Payments along to their users, thus providing USDS users with the equivalent of the Sky Savings Rate.

Integration Boost partners are part of the Integrator Program as defined in [A.2.2.8.1.2.1.1 - Integrator Program](37c38f07-b5a0-40df-939c-a54330ea3c7b). 

Current and onboarding Integrators are recorded in [A.2.2.8.1.2.1.5 - Current And Onboarding Integrators](f3952cc5-cde2-46b9-b575-034dda83570b).

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.1.1 - No Obligation To Pass Through Integration Boost Payments [Core]  <!-- UUID: dc0bc012-2313-4eea-b898-2ebd97c2a59a -->

Integration Boost partners are under no obligation to pass through any portion of Integration Boost payments to their users. Nevertheless, the expectation is that most partners will pass through Integration Boost payments to remain competitive with other protocols.

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.2 - Data Submission [Core]  <!-- UUID: 756b466e-2bc0-43af-957f-d827593f5fe2 -->

The documents herein specify data submission requirements related to the Integrator Program.

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.2.1 - Data Verifiability Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6a2ec8d3-0403-46a9-8c96-3a9c86a59792 -->

Integration Boost Partners must submit net deposit data in such a form that the data can be verified by Sky using on-chain data. In the short term, the Core Council Risk Advisor calculates the net deposit data based on on-chain events and makes it available to Operational GovOps through an API endpoint. The API endpoint is [https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/incentivized-pools/](https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/incentivized-pools/) for Integration Boost Partners on Ethereum and [https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/solana-incentives/](https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/solana-incentives/) on Solana. In the long term, Operational GovOps assumes responsibility for ensuring that the data submission meets the on-chain verifiability requirement; this is done as part of their review of Invocations of the Integration Boost Primitive.

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.2.2 - Data Submission Responsible Party [Core]  <!-- UUID: 079abfa8-583a-4a95-a2d6-7fe50a1dd2dd -->

Integration Boost Partners must also identify a responsible party that will submit the net deposit data. In the near term, this is the Core Council Risk Advisor. In the long term, this may be the Integration Boost Partner, a third party contractor, or the Prime Agent or Operational GovOps themselves if they agree to do so.

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.2.3 - Data Submission Frequency [Core]  <!-- UUID: a26ea73f-ab67-4e02-93cd-b43d22a6e63c -->

Data is calculated on a weekly basis from Monday to Sunday for payment the following Monday. Failure to submit data on time will result in a delay of payment of the Integration Boost until the following week.

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.3 - Distribution [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3b3914d0-eb7b-4a49-bbca-5f6237a4a8ac -->

The documents herein define base elements of the Integration Boost Primitive related to the distribution of the Integration Boost.

In the short term, the Support Facilitators directly pay Integration Boost recipients from Integration Boost wallets. The balance of these wallets on the Ethereum Mainnet may be topped up to 3 million USDS, although the balance of Integration Boost wallets across blockchains may exceed that amount. The funding is subject to an Executive Vote. The addresses of these wallets are:

- Ethereum (ETH) - `0xD6891d1DFFDA6B0B1aF3524018a1eE2E608785F7`
- Solana (SOL) - `7Gf8AqAtmYkkVhQbbJr18RxVUuoGjA8ZEw3Af4NauyaY`
- Solana Hot Wallet - `BKT2JR5wRWsXQBxrht1LbbbKtgUkz3sJdaBY8UzgRJPL`

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.3.2.2 - Long Term Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 787276c9-728b-491f-84d6-c1303fe72986 -->

In the long term, Operational GovOps calculates the Integration Boost for each occurrence of the specified Cadence. Operational GovOps then pays the Integration Boost recipient from its Buffer. Later, Sky Core reimburses the Operational Agent Buffer for the amount paid as part of the Settlement Cycle. This minimizes the role of Sky Core in Integration Boost payments and emphasizes the primary role of the Operational Executor Agent, acting through Operational GovOps, in implementing the Sky Primitives. The process is specified in further detail in [A.2.2.8.2.2.4.1 - Routine Protocol](04864587-25ef-4179-b237-4dd0a23485a4).

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.3.3 - Payment Errors [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8d19b08f-d10e-4db2-9e21-03e5021bdaec -->

If it is discovered that previous Integration Boost calculations were made erroneously, underpayments are resolved retroactively. In cases where an Integrator was overpaid, the Prime Agent associated with the Integrator must reimburse Sky the overpayment amount and can use future Integration Boost payments that the Integrator earns to reimburse itself.

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.4 - Distribution Rewards [Core]  <!-- UUID: d71a7b9c-3d0e-4383-9671-098bead326c1 -->

Net USDS balances in a DeFi protocol that is receiving an Integration Boost are also eligible for the Distribution Reward.

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.4.1 - Reporting Of Net USDS Balances Is Valid Tracking Methodology [Core]  <!-- UUID: a4ca2e70-d013-4c54-8e17-1d6f352ddbc0 -->

The methodology used to report net USDS balances in the protocol for the Integration Boost is itself an acceptable Tracking Methodology for purposes of the Distribution Reward.

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.4.2 - No Double Payments [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5828a3a0-243d-48a5-b537-297015a0c5f5 -->

Distribution Reward may only be paid on net USDS balances of an Integration Boost partner to the extent that a Distribution Reward is not already being paid on those balances.

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.4.3 - Prime Agent May Choose Whether To Share Distribution Reward With Integration Boost Partner [Core]  <!-- UUID: c27d41eb-61f4-4daa-a9c3-b463fa840f60 -->

Prime Agents may choose whether to share Distribution Reward payments with Integration Boost Partners.

###### A.2.2.8.2.2.1.5 - Integration Boost Reimbursement [Core]  <!-- UUID: 63ff5ae5-4a50-4d44-b7e4-526608c44598 -->

##### A.2.2.8.3.1 - Introduction [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4aab68fd-0e8c-4781-b6f6-f94a89cb22fa -->

The documents herein provide an introduction to the Pioneer Chain Primitive.

###### A.2.2.8.3.1.1 - Pioneer Prime Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 219459b3-8333-4e9a-9b79-55e0c20d6dbb -->

Pioneer Primes must be designated by the official team or foundation of the Pioneer Chain, they must be created for the specific purpose of being a Pioneer Prime from their genesis moment, and it is only possible for a Pioneer Chain to have Pioneer Prime once, and for a Pioneer Prime to have the Pioneer Prime status with a single blockchain, once.

###### A.2.2.8.3.1.2 - Pioneer Prime Designation Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: d6d16076-da22-43f1-a303-627af41b486c -->

In order to be confirmed as a Pioneer Prime, a Prime Agent must provide written proof to Operational GovOps that it has been provisionally designated as such by the official team or foundation of the relevant Pioneer Chain. Following a check by Operational GovOps to ensure that the Prime Agent has not been a Pioneer Prime previously and that the Pioneer Chain has not had a Pioneer Prime before, Operational GovOps will add the new Pioneer Prime to the list of Active Pioneer Primes. See [A.2.2.8.3.1.2.1.0.6.1 - List of Active Pioneer Primes](f2ecf6a4-4d5f-4443-b25c-3bd10b1af82e).

###### A.2.2.8.3.1.2.1 - Active Pioneer Primes [Active Data Controller]  <!-- UUID: 65fc0b79-8827-403d-80ee-9f74a6be1069 -->

Active Pioneer Primes are Prime Agents who have been designated by the official team or foundation of the Pioneer Chain and confirmed as Pioneer Primes by Operational GovOps. The list of Current Pioneer Primes is defined as Active Data in [A.2.2.8.3.1.2.1.0.6.1 - List of Active Pioneer Primes](f2ecf6a4-4d5f-4443-b25c-3bd10b1af82e). 

The Active Data is updated as follows:
- The Responsible Party is Operational GovOps.
- The Update Process must follow the protocol for ‘Direct Edit’.

###### A.2.2.8.3.1.2.1.0.6.1 - List of Active Pioneer Primes [Active Data]  <!-- UUID: f2ecf6a4-4d5f-4443-b25c-3bd10b1af82e -->

###### A.2.2.8.3.1.3 - Pioneer Prime Benefits [Core]  <!-- UUID: f0d5ab5e-bf35-4a9d-a73f-d82baac6e604 -->

Pioneer Primes gain benefits and responsibilities related to the general adoption of USDS on the Pioneer Chain, and this benefit comes in two forms.

First, during the Pioneer Phase, the Pioneer Prime counts as having tagged, for the purposes of calculating the Distribution Reward, all USDS and sUSDS accounts and balances on the Pioneer Chain that have not been tagged by another Prime. At the end of the Pioneer Phase, all untagged USDS accounts and balances are one-time tagged by the Pioneer Prime, and this tag will remain normally for the following ten (10) years unless tagged by a different Prime, or retagged.

Second, during the Pioneer Phase, all Unrewarded USDS bridged to the Pioneer Chain counts towards Pioneer Incentive payments, see [A.2.2.8.3.1.4 - Pioneer Incentive Pool](04edac33-19d5-4a87-a8ab-945a0cd57771).

###### A.2.2.8.3.1.3.1 - Pioneer Phase [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0c7b0644-68d4-441d-8221-88382a6515e4 -->

For purposes of [A.2.2.8.3.1.3 - Pioneer Prime Benefits](f0d5ab5e-bf35-4a9d-a73f-d82baac6e604), the Pioneer Phase is a period beginning on the date that a Prime Agent satisfies the Pioneer Prime Requirements specified in [A.2.2.8.3.1.1 - Pioneer Prime Requirements](219459b3-8333-4e9a-9b79-55e0c20d6dbb) and ending three (3) years thereafter.

###### A.2.2.8.3.1.4 - Pioneer Incentive Pool [Core]  <!-- UUID: 04edac33-19d5-4a87-a8ab-945a0cd57771 -->

All Pioneer Incentive payments are paid through the Monthly Settlement Cycle. Each Monthly Settlement Cycle, an amount of funds equivalent to the Sky Savings Rate multiplied by the balance of Unrewarded USDS is paid into a separate account controlled by the Pioneer Prime (the "Pioneer Incentive Pool"). 80% of the funds going to the Pioneer Incentive Pool are not the property of the Pioneer Primes and must instead be used as incentives to promote general adoption of USDS on the Pioneer Chain. This must provide general benefit for the sake of growing USDS activity on the Pioneer Chain and cannot be biased towards benefiting the Pioneer Prime. The remaining 20% of the funds going to the Pioneer Incentive Pool may be retained by the Pioneer Prime as income.

###### A.2.2.8.3.1.4.1 - Pre-Pioneer Incentive Pool [Core]  <!-- UUID: 15e14f25-8d56-4699-ac37-0cef4f0503c5 -->

A Pre-Pioneer Incentive Pool is a temporary, chain-specific incentive mechanism designed to bootstrap USDS adoption on a new blockchain before a formal Pioneer Prime is established for that chain. It allows a designated Agent to direct incentive payments to ecosystem partners on that specific chain. The Pre-Pioneer Incentive Pool may operate under distinct rules that differ from the standard Pioneer Incentive Pool, which rules will be specified in an Ecosystem Accord between the respective Agent and Sky Core. A Pre-Pioneer Incentive Pool serves as a transitional phase until the conditions for a formal Pioneer Incentive Pool are met. See [A.2.2.8.3.1.4 - Pioneer Incentive Pool](04edac33-19d5-4a87-a8ab-945a0cd57771).

### A.2.2.9 - Supply Side Stablecoin Primitives [Section]  <!-- UUID: d1142876-33c2-4e21-9339-d8711525d46f -->

Supply Side Stablecoin Primitives are Sky Primitives focused on capital allocation and risk management.

#### A.2.2.9.1 - Allocation System Primitive [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9db14ab7-bb4b-4751-8084-843bd4359f2a -->

The Allocation System Primitive is the base mechanism that enables Prime Agents to put up Risk Capital to deploy USDS collateral into different opportunities that provide risk-adjusted return, by borrowing at the Base Rate from Sky, and following Asset Liability Management restrictions on the liquidity of deployed assets.

##### A.2.2.9.1.1 - Allocation System Process Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 823a12c3-45d2-438a-b061-46ecd09cdca8 -->

The documents herein define the process for initial setup and ongoing management of an Allocation Instance (alternatively referred to as "conduits") as part of the Allocation System Primitive.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1 - Base Elements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 39f3ceee-2e0b-41b2-ad62-85cac3895cb0 -->

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.1 - Sky Direct Exposures [Core]  <!-- UUID: b3fb8653-8503-4a9e-81b2-5e9f49ad6703 -->

Sky Direct Exposures are exposures that are held directly by Sky but implemented through the Allocation System of a Prime Agent. The documents herein define the rules for Sky Direct Exposures.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.1.1 - Designation Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3161489a-11bd-4dea-b676-09d0cce45ae9 -->

Sky Direct Exposures are designated by the Core Facilitator in consultation with the Core Council Risk Advisor via posts to the Sky Forum under the "Sky Core" category. Sky Direct Exposures are recorded in [A.2.2.9.1.1.1.1.2.0.6.1 - List Of Current Sky Direct Exposures](5f368e33-7a82-4244-a9ba-f285193ec043) and must specify the asset that is being designated as a Sky Direct Exposure and the Prime Agent responsible for implementing the exposure.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.1.2 - Current Sky Direct Exposures [Active Data Controller]  <!-- UUID: 1c0410e4-fe36-4a01-8b82-8ea74f67fbec -->

The list of current Sky Direct Exposures is defined as Active Data in [A.2.2.9.1.1.1.1.2.0.6.1 - List Of Current Sky Direct Exposures](5f368e33-7a82-4244-a9ba-f285193ec043). 

The Active Data is updated as follows:
- The Responsible Party is the Core Facilitator.
- The Update Process must follow the protocol for ‘Direct Edit’.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.1.2.0.6.1 - List Of Current Sky Direct Exposures [Active Data]  <!-- UUID: 5f368e33-7a82-4244-a9ba-f285193ec043 -->

The current Sky Direct Exposures are:
    
- Treasury Bills - Investments by Grove in BUIDL, JTRSY, and USTB on Ethereum Mainnet
- Collateralized Loan Obligations - Investments by Grove in JAAA on Ethereum Mainnet up to 325M USD
- Peg Stability Modules - Investments by Spark or Grove in USDC in Peg Stability Modules on blockchains other than Ethereum Mainnet
- Curve Pools - Investments by Spark in USDT in sUSDS/USDT Curve pools

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.1.3 - Parameters For Sky Direct Exposures [Core]  <!-- UUID: cbd64e6c-547b-4b8d-a0cb-b605f780aef1 -->

The Core Facilitator sets the following parameters for Sky Direct Exposures in consultation with the Core Council Risk Advisor:

- Rate limits; and

- Aggregate exposure limits.

The Core Facilitator must post the initial values for these parameters and any updates to them to the Sky Forum under the "Sky Core" category. The values for the parameters for Sky Direct Exposures are set by the Core Facilitator and supersede any values for these parameters specified in the Risk Framework.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.1.3.1 - Treatment Of Exposures In Excess Of Aggregate Exposure Limit [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8bd63c6b-b9ad-46e3-beb0-77c4a47bcd6d -->

Any investments in assets that would otherwise qualify as Sky Direct Exposures by a Prime Agent in excess of the aggregate exposure limit are not Sky Direct Exposures and are subject to the customary requirements pursuant to [A.2.4 - Sky Core Monthly Settlement Cycle](6f8d5065-d6ff-4add-9a28-eadeffa7ed1a) and [A.3.2 - Risk Capital](55999acf-75fe-4adf-8584-9746ef50d3e4).

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.1.4 - Revenue Sharing For Sky Direct Exposures [Core]  <!-- UUID: 07e0f716-ce23-4394-a5f4-bee537713f48 -->

Because Sky Direct Exposures are held by Sky rather than the Prime Agent implementing the exposure through its Allocation System, Prime Agents are not required to pay the Agent Credit Line Borrow Rate with respect to funds borrowed to finance Sky Direct Exposures. All yield on Sky Direct Exposures is also due exclusively to Sky and is not retained by the Prime Agent. This is implemented as an adjustment to the Monthly Settlement Cycle.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.1.5 - No Risk Capital Requirements With Respect To Sky Direct Exposures [Core]  <!-- UUID: b683953e-d9b0-4e15-a405-978ef1854870 -->

Because Sky Direct Exposures are held by Sky rather than the Prime Agent implementing the exposure through its Allocation System, Prime Agents are not required to hold any Risk Capital with respect to Sky Direct Exposures.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.1.6 - No Actively Stabilizing Collateral Requirements With Respect To Sky Direct Exposures [Core]  <!-- UUID: bfb8013f-9226-4426-84bf-4b0e03b44107 -->

Because Sky Direct Exposures are held by Sky rather than the Prime Agent implementing the exposure through its Allocation System, Prime Agents are not required to hold any Actively Stabilizing Collateral with respect to Sky Direct Exposures. Sky Direct Exposures also do not count towards satisfying a Prime Agent’s Actively Stabilizing Collateral requirements.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.2 - Liquidity Layer Parameter Definitions [Core]  <!-- UUID: a8a3e54d-980e-435d-9e08-0e5775af9aa3 -->

The documents herein define common parameters of implementations of the Allocation System based on the Spark Liquidity Layer, including the Grove Liquidity Layer.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.2.1 - Rate Limiter [Core]  <!-- UUID: a578830d-18f0-451c-8ff0-4a66094650ae -->

Rate Limiter refers to the overall mechanism or system that limits the volume of token movements over time, implemented via the `RateLimits` contracts. The Rate Limiter manages multiple rate limits and enforces constraints on controller operations to prevent rapid asset drainage and mitigate risks from compromised relayers or other attacks. This ensures that the maximum amount of tokens processed within a specific time period stays within safe bounds. The `RateLimits` contracts and their addresses for each chain can be found in the Allocation System Primitive for a Prime, under ALM Contracts.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.2.2 - Rate Limits [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8efb0a11-b798-48eb-af19-f65b38f039b5 -->

Rate limits set the maximum allowable amount of tokens that can be processed for specific operations within a given time period. Each rate limit contains the rate limit data: `maxAmount`, `slope`, `lastAmount` and `lastUpdated`.  The current rate limit is calculated using the formula:

`currentRateLimit = min(slope * (block.timestamp - lastUpdated) + lastAmount, maxAmount)`.

The rate limit data `maxAmount` and `slope` are configurable parameters that are set and modified by Governance. The rate limit data `lastAmount` and `lastUpdated` are internal state data dynamically tracked by the Rate Limiter to perform its calculations.

Rate limits set caps on the rate of allocation to a given Instance, they do not act as a limit on the total amount that may be allocated to that Instance.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.2.2.1 - MaxAmount [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8b5f1ffd-9dfd-4aa0-8fc2-638a79d9fadb -->

`maxAmount` sets a hard cap on the level of allocation to an Instance at any given time. It sets the absolute rate limit regardless of how much time has passed since the last allocation. For example, if `maxAmount` is set to 1,000,000 tokens, the rate limit will increase over time at the rate determined by the `slope` until it reaches 1,000,000 tokens, at this point the rate limit will stop increasing, but it will resume increasing once an allocation to the Instance has been made.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.2.2.2 - Slope [Core]  <!-- UUID: ae8674bc-44ac-4b95-b5df-c6322a1d6e9a -->

`slope` is the linear refill rate of a rate limiter’s allowance over time. It defines how quickly the capacity to perform additional inflow or outflow accrues after prior consumption. For example, if the slope is set to 1,000,000 tokens per day (converted to per second for on-chain execution), the rate limit will recover at that rate until it reaches the maxAmount.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.2.2.3 - LastUpdated [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8d0419a4-50c5-4a7b-b68e-84d8c9243694 -->

`lastUpdated` is the timestamp when the rate limit was last updated, serving as the reference point for calculating time-elapsed refills in the formula.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.2.2.4 - LastAmount [Core]  <!-- UUID: 02918cfc-5d10-41bc-bb8a-0be9df76cbac -->

`lastAmount` is the remaining allowance available at the last update, used to compute the current rate limit by adding accrued capacity.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.2.3 - Inflow Rate Limits [Core]  <!-- UUID: d59a233c-11b9-4140-b15f-51df37475fd8 -->

Inflow rate limits constrain the rate at which allocated liquidity can increase into a scope. "Inflow" means movements that raise exposure or capital allocated to an Instance or market, such as depositing, minting, or rebalancing into a position.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.2.4 - Outflow Rate Limits [Core]  <!-- UUID: e50fd86a-ffa4-4387-b212-420730a8d171 -->

Outflow Rate Limits constrain the rate at which allocated liquidity can be withdrawn or exposure reduced from a scope. "Outflow" means movements that lower exposure or capital allocated to an Instance or market, such as withdrawals, redemptions, or unwind operations.

Outflow limits are often configured more permissively to prioritize safety and fast exits. When outflow limits are "unlimited," the rate limits contract simply does not apply a cap in that direction.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.2.5 - Rate Limit IDs [Core]  <!-- UUID: b95b3bd8-d316-43d5-af56-df38d557aea3 -->

A `Rate Limit ID` is a bytes32 key that uniquely identifies a rate limit. Rate Limit IDs allow the system to maintain independent allowance state for each relevant transaction.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.1.2.6 - MaxSlippage [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7c6da187-7d17-42ae-8c64-8d828ee83ea7 -->

`maxSlippage` is a configurable parameter that sets the maximum allowed price impact or deviation from expected output when executing trades or liquidity operations in a pool. `maxslippage` is expressed as a decimal and must be a non-zero value. This protects against excessive price impact during volatile market conditions.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2 - Allocation Instance Setup Process Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: f47513f6-34e4-40a4-b7ff-8d68d75070be -->

The documents herein define the process for setting up an Allocation Instance as part of the Allocation System Primitive.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.1 - Real World Agreements And Planning [Core]  <!-- UUID: eeeeb5ff-3f11-4857-a3da-ad354569f833 -->

The documents herein define the preliminary, off-chain human coordination stage of setting up an Allocation Instance.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.1.1 - Initial Concept And Feasibility Discussions [Core]  <!-- UUID: b60b170f-9e8c-4577-a046-313039ff25ba -->

The Prime Agent identifies a yield opportunity on a target chain that can exceed the Base Rate. The Prime Agent estimates Required Risk Capital (RRC) and Asset Liability Management requirements associated with the opportunity and evaluates options for fulfilling them. The Prime Agent also considers exchange and bridging costs, if applicable. Based on this, the Prime Agent develops a net yield target for the opportunity factoring in all of these costs. The output of this step is an internal meeting note summarizing the idea as well as estimates of Required Risk Capital, Asset Liability Management, and exchange / bridging costs.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.1.2 - Preliminary Required Risk Capital and Asset Liability Management Arrangement [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8d3b553c-440d-4c67-b661-37ab1edc1c58 -->

If necessary, the Prime Agent reaches out to other Prime Agents that could provide Junior Risk Capital (JRC) / Senior Risk Capital (SRC) or assume Asset Liability Management obligations. The Prime Agent negotiates with these other Prime Agents and documents these potential deals. The output of this step is an informal confirmation of JRC/SRC and Asset Liability Management transfer details.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.1.3 - Prime Agent Preparation Of Capital And Operational Plan [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4aa05a21-86d6-451e-a1b1-2afd1107edba -->

The Capital and Operational Plan ("C&O Plan") articulates the Prime Agent’s strategy for a proposed new Allocation Instance or a modification to an existing Instance. In addition to articulating the Instance’s strategic objectives and operational parameters, the C&O Plan includes a pro-forma Required Risk Capital (RRC) estimate and a strategy for ensuring sufficient Total Risk Capital (TRC) coverage. 

The C&O Plan is the major input into the Artifact Edit Proposal that codifies the new or modified Instance. Following the approval of such a proposal by Prime governance, the details and commitments outlined in the C&O Plan are formally integrated into the respective Instance Configuration Document of the Prime Agent’s Artifact.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.1.3.1 - Pro-Forma Instance RRC Estimate [Core]  <!-- UUID: c3b53ee8-328a-4a79-8afe-ac0de99d8706 -->

As a critical component of the Capital & Operational Plan, the Prime Agent must prepare an initial pro-forma Instance Required Risk Capital (RRC) estimate. This estimate serves as the basis for the Prime’s capital planning prior to the availability of official RRC figures from Sky Core. The estimate must strictly adhere to the implementation of RRC-models defined in [A.3.2 - Risk Capital](55999acf-75fe-4adf-8584-9746ef50d3e4).

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.1.3.2 - Notional Total Risk Capital (TRC) Coverage Strategy [Core]  <!-- UUID: a30447be-5214-4398-82aa-7306eeabd6f5 -->

As a critical component of the Capital & Operational Plan, the Prime Agent must articulate its strategy for ensuring its Total Risk Capital (TRC) adequately covers the pro-forma Instance RRC of a new or modified Instance and the resulting impact on its Aggregate RRC.

The Prime’s notional TRC coverage strategy must outline how this new Instance’s RRC will be notionally accounted for or supported by the Prime’s overall TRC pool. If the Prime’s current TRC is not sufficient to cover its estimated increased Aggregate RRC, the strategy should outline the Prime Agent’s intended steps for acquiring additional JRC/SRC.

For instance, this risk-capital acquisition strategy could involve:
    
1. Renting Junior Risk Capital (JRC)    
◦ Sourcing Prime-External Junior Risk Capital (SEJRC) by renting it from other Primes through Ecosystem Accords.    
◦ Sourcing Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital (TEJRC) from external capital providers.
    
2. Sourcing Senior Risk Capital (SRC):    
◦ Originating SRC through the Sky monthly auction.    
◦ Renting OSRC from other Primes through Ecosystem Accords.
    
3. Increasing Internal Junior Risk Capital (IJRC): A Prime might have plans to bolster its own IJRC through retained earnings or other internal means.
    
4. Decreasing exposure in an existing Instance(s) to lower Aggregate RRC.

The Prime’s capital-acquisition strategy should indicate how the Prime will remain in compliance with all relevant Atlas rules, such as sourcing ratios that constrain how much Senior Risk Capital can be "enabled" or counted toward a Prime’s Aggregate RRC. See [A.3.2.1.2.3 - Total Risk Capital Sourcing Ratios](9e99b084-f15a-4f60-b831-d6c0bd9aec04).

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.1.3.3 - Additional Elements Of Capital And Operational Plan [Core]  <!-- UUID: a156b120-8b27-4a31-95fe-4154205ca102 -->

The Capital & Operational Plan includes the following additional elements:
    
◦ Operational Parameters: defines the Instance’s target chain(s), protocols, initial capital, maximum deposit sizes, and any other parameters that underpin the pro-forma RRC calculation.    

◦ Data Submission Protocol: defines how yields, Required Risk Capital usage, ALM costs, exchange data, etc. will be reported and audited.    

◦ Emergency Procedures: defines mechanisms to be triggered if security or risk capital thresholds are breached, such as a kill switch or partial freeze.    

◦ Asset Liability Management (ALM) Strategy: details if the Prime will meet its ALM requirements through its own direct asset management or by transferring its obligations to another Prime Agent via the ASC Rental Primitive. If the latter, the C&O Plan must reference the governing Ecosystem Accord and its key terms.    

◦ Performance-based Adjustments: define the conditions or KPIs that allow adjustments to Instance deposit caps or yield expansions without requiring a formal Artifact edit.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.1.4 - Preliminary Informal Check With Operational GovOps [Core]  <!-- UUID: e7d3d696-e2d0-4d4b-b4d6-c7a0c47b7cc6 -->

The Prime Agent presents the Capital and Operational Plan for the Allocation Instance to Operational GovOps, including any associated JRC/SRC and Asset Liability Management arrangements. Operational GovOps reviews and either provides an informal greenlight or requests modifications to the Plan. The output of this step is Operational GovOps approval to proceed with a request to revise the C&O Plan, as applicable.

The documents herein define how agreements to set up an Allocation Instance are codified and validated in the Powerhouse system and how governance votes happen.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.2.1 - Agent Inputs [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7a36f228-0438-43da-ae5f-a43af70c0121 -->

The Prime Agent drafts an update to the Prime Agent Artifact adding the Allocation Instance to the list of active Allocation Instances and including the information specified in [A.2.2.9.1.2.6 - List Of Allocation Instances](e4975062-6d19-438b-a5d5-cfc1a7fd8cb9). The Prime Agent submits the draft to the Powerhouse system. The output of this step is a draft Prime Agent Artifact update in the Powerhouse system.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.2.2 - Validation And Off-Chain Vote [Core]  <!-- UUID: dbae3918-75f7-469d-b623-8faa5ea7aa70 -->

The Operational Executor Facilitator reviews the proposal to ensure that it is complete and aligned with the Atlas. The Operational Executor Facilitator then initiates an off-chain snapshot vote, following the quorum and majority rules in the Prime Agent Artifact. When complete, the result of the vote is recorded in the Powerhouse system. The output of this step is the snapshot vote result recorded in the Powerhouse system.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.2.3 - Official Update of Artifact [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2b1612b8-480c-49b3-a304-6a6f593340de -->

If the Allocation Instance is successfully approved, the Operational Executor Facilitator finalizes and publishes the update to the Prime Agent Artifact, making it effective in the Atlas. The output of this step is an updated Prime Agent Artifact with the new Allocation Instance. 

Once a new Instance is deployed, its data is integrated into risk-capital monitoring systems and its RRC will be officially determined and tracked via the Sky Core RRC Dashboard/API. See [A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.1 - Sky Core Required Risk Capital (RRC) Dashboard And API](4eac2c9e-2718-4881-a3f1-ed10fb3f4d13). This official RRC figure supersedes the Prime-prepared pro-forma RRC.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.3 - Instance Setup Deployments [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3766cb8c-ab6c-41af-9465-b8dea76d0532 -->

The documents herein define how the deployment of an Allocation Instance is executed on-chain. In the short-term, an Allocation Instance may also be deployed using the process for Interim Deployments specified in [A.1.9.2.3.2.2.2 - Interim Deployments](9b3edbbf-89d1-42da-a9c3-18f858f8471f).

The Prime Agent must subsequently prepare a pro-forma Required Risk Capital estimate, which must be approved by the Core Council Risk Advisor, before the parameters of the Instance can be updated for normal operation.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.3.1 - Conduit Development And Testing [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6899a722-3d1a-4bd1-80f2-f36be91bbab0 -->

Once formally validated, the Prime Agent implements the new Allocation Instance based on the specifications in the Prime Agent Artifact. Operational GovOps must test the Allocation Instance with minimal funds from the Prime Agent’s Central Allocation Buffer, verifying deposit / withdrawal logic, slippage constraints, and oracle checks. If this testing is successful Operational GovOps confirms that the Allocation Instance satisfies all risk constraints specified in the Prime Agent Artifact. The output of this step is validated contracts for the Allocation Instance and a green light to proceed with a scaled deployment.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.2.3.2 - Initial Deployment and Required Risk Capital / Asset Liability Management Execution [Core]  <!-- UUID: 648bcae7-9723-4282-81fe-fcc77fd6f90e -->

The Prime Agent finalizes JRC/SRC and Asset Liability Management Arrangements. Operational GovOps records these arrangements in the Powerhouse interface. If Operational GovOps is charged with operationalizing an Instance, it deploys funds from the Prime Agent’s Operational Buffer into the Allocation Instance, performing any necessary DEX exchanges. See [A.2.2.9.1.1.3.1 - Operationalization Of Allocation Instances](989512c2-4fa1-46b8-947c-00e3c0b56024). In doing so, Operational GovOps follows instructions in the Agent Artifact regarding the amount of capital to deploy and slippage tolerances. The output of this step is a fully deployed Allocation Instance conforming to Risk Capital and Asset Liability Management requirements.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3 - Allocation Instance Ongoing Management [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2db14aa7-ccfa-42f7-82a8-118048574d4c -->

Prime Agent teams may choose to directly operationalize their Allocation System Primitive Instances ("Instances") using internal, proprietary strategies that are not defined in their Artifacts. Alternatively, Prime Agents may elect to have the Instances operationalized by their Operational Executor Agent. This constitutes an exception to the general rule that Operational Executor Agents operationalize all Sky Primitives on behalf of Prime Agents. See [A.1.13.3.4 - Agent Role Delineation](fdf32ca5-5e2e-481e-9047-4d1599547216). 

For Prime Agent teams that operationalize their Instances, they will be required to formulate KPIs for their proprietary strategies; should an Instance under-perform these KPIs, Operational GovOps is authorized to step in and operationalize the Instance(s) via a back-up strategy that is defined in the Agent Artifact. Additional logic on this point will be defined in a future iteration of the Atlas.

The Sky Core Required Risk Capital (RRC) Dashboard and its associated API serve as the official system for determining and disseminating RRC figures for Prime Agents and their Allocation System Primitive Instances.

Prior to the full operational deployment of the Powerhouse system, Prime Agents must utilize the Sky Core RRC Dashboard/API as the authoritative source for their official Instance Total RRCs and Aggregate RRC. Data from these sources is to be used for all internal TRC management,  required reporting and compliance assessments.

The Sky Core RRC Dashboard is located at [https://sphere.blockanalitica.com/rrc](https://sphere.blockanalitica.com/rrc). The Sky Core RRC API is located at [https://sphere-api.blockanalitica.com/rrc/](https://sphere-api.blockanalitica.com/rrc/).

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.1.1 - Role and Functionality of the RRC Dashboard and API [Core]  <!-- UUID: f7da0f56-00f5-4bcf-bd31-b77c284c7992 -->

The RRC Dashboard provides a user interface for Prime Agents to view their official RRC figures. The RRC API allows Prime Agents to programmatically access this same data for integration into their internal TRC management systems. Both the Dashboard and API provide the following key information:
    
◦ Instance Total RRC: For each specific Allocation System Primitive Instance, the system displays its Instance Total RRC. This figure is the sum of all applicable risk-specific RRC calculations for that Instance, including:
        ◦ Instance Financial RRC ([A.3.2.1.1.4 - Instance Financial RRC](ba1d5c0e-399f-47a6-b5d4-b3f5477d5787)) 
        ◦ Instance Smart Contract RRC ([A.3.2.1.1.5 - Instance Smart Contract RRC](4b4ea578-28b4-481c-9abd-d34c5a4f383c))  
        ◦ Instance Administrative RRC ([A.3.2.1.1.6 - Instance Administrative RRC](c2b60f0d-6555-463c-9ad3-2a9746be77c5)) 

The models for certain risk-factors are still currently under development. See [A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.1.2 - Interim Notice Regarding RRC Dashboard/API Coverage](18243e7a-5b62-459d-83fb-e50b9df05f9d). 
    
◦ Aggregate RRC: For each Prime Agent, the system displays its Aggregate RRC, which is the sum of all its Instance Total RRCs. This is the figure against which a Prime Agent’s Total Risk Capital (TRC) adequacy is assessed.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.1.2 - Interim Notice Regarding RRC Dashboard/API Coverage [Core]  <!-- UUID: 18243e7a-5b62-459d-83fb-e50b9df05f9d -->

Some Allocation System Instances displayed on the RRC Dashboard concern asset types whose risk models have not yet been fully developed. See [A.3.2.1.1.4.3 - Financial Risk Models](2af9fa64-ab25-4017-920c-f1c07dff4c06). An active Instance’s respective Instance Configuration Document will specify its `RRC Framework Full Implementation` status as either `Covered` or `Pending`.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.2 - Primes' Total Risk Capital (TRC) Management [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3af8a3a2-25e5-44b3-87a4-7df1f2712685 -->

Prime Agent teams are responsible for managing their Total Risk Capital (TRC) to continuously meet their Aggregate Required Risk Capital (RRC). The accounting of TRC considers all on-chain holdings and any off-chain agreements, encumbrances, or conditions that may affect the immediate availability or eligibility of capital for RRC coverage. For a definition of Total Risk Capital, see [A.3.2.1.2.1 - Total Risk Capital Definition](6f6b25d6-f73c-4733-ba37-12a0a411433c).

The documents herein define requirements and standards for a Prime Agent’s internal TRC management systems.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.2.1 - Objective of Prime TRC Management [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9a8120c4-0a5b-426f-97a5-283c708413f5 -->

To comply with Atlas risk capital requirements, Prime Agent teams must establish, maintain, and operate an internal system for TRC management. A Prime Agent’s internal TRC management system should enable proactive operational risk management. This entails ongoing capital adequacy assessment and strategic capital allocation planning for current and future Allocation System Primitive Instances, including the ability to perform scenario analyses for potential deployments or market stresses.

Prime Agents’ internal TRC management systems should enable them to maintain continuous sufficiency of the Prime Agent’s held TRC against its official Aggregate RRC. This requires real-time or near real-time comparison and internal alerting mechanisms to prevent and address potential shortfalls.
Primes must ensure that their internal TRC management systems maintain comprehensive, verifiable internal records of all TRC components, related transactions, and compliance activities to support internal governance and external verification processes, such as the submission of TRC Reports to Core GovOps. See [A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.2.3 - Primes’ TRC Report](41ca2085-d71b-47e5-8b1a-b183b6e2b6fc).

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.2.2 - Minimum Capabilities of Prime TRC Management Systems [Core]  <!-- UUID: d034533f-9b6f-411c-8b60-3bccb374765f -->

A Prime Agent’s internal TRC management system should possess the following capabilities to meet the objectives outlined in [A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.2.1 - Objective of Prime TRC Management](9a8120c4-0a5b-426f-97a5-283c708413f5). 
    
1. Prime Agents’ internal TRC management systems should enable compliant sourcing and tracking of all TRC components, including Internal Junior Risk Capital (IJRC), Prime-External Junior Risk Capital (SEJRC), Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital (TEJRC), and Originated Senior Risk Capital (OSRC). Compliance in this context includes strict adherence to eligibility criteria and capital-sourcing ratios (e.g., External Per Internal, Senior Per Junior) as defined in the Atlas. See [A.3.2.1.2.3 - Total Risk Capital Sourcing Ratios](9e99b084-f15a-4f60-b831-d6c0bd9aec04). 

The system must provide real-time or near real-time tracking of all held Total Risk Capital (TRC) components. This includes, for each TRC component:
        ◦ Accurate valuation of the assets comprising each component.
        ◦ Clear identification of the source of each component (e.g., Prime’s own SubProxy for IJRC, specific Ecosystem Accord references for rented SEJRC or OSRC, TEJRC encumbrance details, OSRC origination details).
        ◦ Verification of each TRC component’s eligibility status according to Atlas rules. This includes tracking whether capital is "enabled" or "active" for RRC coverage purposes (e.g., based on Ecosystem Accord status, compliance with sourcing ratios, etc.).
        ◦ Distinction between capital directly held by the Prime Agent and capital that is encumbered (e.g., SEJRC where the lending Prime retains custody but the capital is contractually committed).
    
2. Prime Agents’ internal TRC management systems should enable dynamic-state accounting. The system must account for TRC components that are in dynamic, pending, or off-chain states, as these can impact the true risk capital available to a Prime Agent. This includes:
        ◦ Pending transactions such as SEJRC or OSRC rental Ecosystem Accords that have been committed to by the parties, but not yet codified in the Atlas.
        ◦ Capital in transit, e.g., assets that are committed to be IJRC, but currently moving between chains via bridges or locked in Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) messages awaiting finality.
        ◦ Operational expenditures funded by TRC components (typically IJRC), such as blockchain transaction fees, oracle service fees, audit costs, and other operational overhead that reduces available risk capital. The system should track these expenditures in real-time or near real-time.
        ◦ Any off-chain factors that could impair the immediate deployability or availability of TRC components.
    
3. Prime Agents’ internal TRC management systems should enable continuous capital adequacy monitoring. The system must enable the near real-time comparison of the Prime Agent’s internally tracked and calculated TRC against its official Aggregate RRC, as obtained from the Sky Core RRC Dashboard/API. See [A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.1 - Sky Core Required Risk Capital (RRC) Dashboard And API](4eac2c9e-2718-4881-a3f1-ed10fb3f4d13). This core functionality is essential for the Prime Agent to proactively monitor its capital adequacy, identify potential or actual TRC shortfalls, and make timely operational and capital management decisions to maintain compliance.
    
4. Prime Agents’ internal TRC management systems should define a RRC-incident (e.g., TRC shortfall) response protocol. The system should enable internal alerting mechanisms that detect when a Prime Agent’s TRC approaches predefined internal buffer thresholds relative to its Aggregate RRC. See [A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1 - Encumbrance Ratio](5435f680-aaaa-461a-bcae-4056bb8964d9). The system should also detect an actual shortfall where the Prime Agent’s held TRC falls below its Aggregate RRC.
Furthermore, Prime Agent teams should establish and document internal processes for responding to such alerts. Such internal processes should include: 1) internal escalation and assessment of the shortfall’s cause and magnitude; 2) formulation of potential responses or corrective actions, which may include sourcing additional TRC, reducing risk-weighted exposures, or other measures; 3) internal decision-making framework for the evaluation of potential responses and selection of the most appropriate one; and 4) notifying any pertinent parties (Operational GovOps) as needed for the purpose of planning or implementing follow-up action.

Prime Agent teams’ internal decision-making framework may consider the economic trade-offs of various actions, including the strategic acceptance of penalties for a TRC shortfall where such an approach is determined to be economically advantageous compared to immediate rebalancing (e.g., avoiding excessive transaction costs or market impact).

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.2.3 - Primes’ TRC Report [Core]  <!-- UUID: 41ca2085-d71b-47e5-8b1a-b183b6e2b6fc -->

Prime Agents are required to submit periodic Total Risk Capital (TRC) Reports to provide an accurate and verifiable attestation of their TRC composition and adherence to capital requirements.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.2.3.1 - Mandate and Rationale [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7e95efa7-e409-48dc-9b5a-96edce54bf31 -->

Prime Agents are required to periodically submit TRC Reports to Core GovOps. This report serves a dual purpose. It provides a verifiable snapshot of the Prime Agent's TRC composition and key capital ratios as of the end of the reporting period; and second, it provides a formal attestation regarding the Prime Agent's maintenance of TRC at or above its dynamically changing Aggregate Required Risk Capital (RRC) throughout the entire reporting period. See [A.3.2.1.1.2 - Aggregate RRC](6aed5cc1-9671-4b73-88a9-fdd86ac93ece). 

This comprehensive reporting, encompassing both an end-of-period statement and disclosures of any intra-period events affecting TRC, is essential. On-chain data alone (such as that captured by the planned OVRC system) cannot definitively prove the full eligibility and unimpaired availability of a Prime Agent's capital position for continuous RRC coverage, nor can it capture all off-chain factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether assets are subject to Prime-initiated off-chain contractual pledges, if the economic value or redeemability of its bridged assets is compromised by issues with their originating bridge, or if its assets are encumbered by derivative structures or other off-chain commitments that would impair their immediate use at any point during the period.

The TRC Report serves as an important basis for Core GovOps’  verification procedures. This entails: 1) reconciling reported end-of-period TRC components against the Sky Atlas, on-chain data, and other relevant sources to validate the period-end capital position and adherence to Atlas-defined capital requirements; and 2) reviewing Prime Agents’ attestations and disclosures regarding its TRC management and any material events throughout the reporting period to assess continuous compliance with its dynamically changing Aggregate RRC. The outcome of this validation is a critical input for the monthly settlement cycles, which latter includes the determination and retroactive application of penalties for any identified discrepancies or violations of capital requirements during the period.

The long-term vision is for the Powerhouse system to enable the automation of TRC data aggregation and verification. The Powerhouse system will have capabilities such as directly querying Prime Agent SubProxy accounts for IJRC assets, programmatically accessing and interpreting Ecosystem Accords recorded in the Atlas, interfacing with TEJRC and OSRC smart contract systems, and automatically applying Atlas-defined eligibility rules. See [A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.3.1 - Continuous Monitoring Of On-chain Verifiable Risk Capital (OVRC)](8048bdf0-84b7-4546-8f1a-98b62d073c84). Even in this advanced state, the TRC Report, or a similar form of periodic attestation, may remain necessary to cover elements of TRC verification that are not fully able to be automated or require explicit Prime Agent declaration.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.2.3.2 - TRC Report Contents [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4887e971-be6c-4f98-9137-7cdec3ed0fa0 -->

The Total Risk Capital (TRC) Report submitted by a Prime Agent must provide an accurate and verifiable breakdown of all TRC components held by the Prime Agent as of the end of the specified reporting period. The TRC Report should include the following essential information:
    
◦ Aggregate TRC Value As of End of Period: The total declared value in USD of all eligible TRC components held by the Prime Agent as of the end of the reporting period.
    
◦ Detailed Breakdown of TRC Components As of End of Period: For each category of TRC held, the report must detail the following values as of the end of the reporting period:
        ◦ Internal Junior Risk Capital (IJRC): The total amount of IJRC, a breakdown of its constituent asset types, and their respective values in USD.
        ◦ Prime-External Junior Risk Capital (SEJRC): The total amount of SEJRC. For each portion of SEJRC sourced from another Prime Agent, the report must include the amount in USD, the identifier of the counterparty Prime Agent, the expiry date of the arrangement, and a direct reference to the Ecosystem Accord that governs the SEJRC arrangement.
        ◦ Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital (TEJRC): The total amount of TEJRC. For each TEJRC source, the report must include the amount in USD, the identifier of the TEJRC smart contract or facility and any relevant encumbrance identifier.
        ◦ Originated Senior Risk Capital (OSRC): The total amount of OSRC. The report must specify the amount originated directly by the Prime Agent from the Total Senior Risk Capital (TSRC) pool and any amount of OSRC rented from other Prime Agents. For any rented OSRC, the report must include the amount in USD, the identifier of the counterparty Prime Agent, the expiry date, and a direct reference to the pertinent Ecosystem Accord.
        ◦ Key Ratio Inputs and Computed Totals (Prime Internal Calculation) As Of End Of Period:  Based on the component values reported above (as of the end of the reporting period), the report must include key figures used in and resulting from the Prime Agent's internal capital adequacy calculations. These figures reflect the capital structure and ratios as of the end of the reporting period and include:
            - Internal Junior Risk Capital (IJRC)
            - External Junior Risk Capital (EJRC) generated via External Per Internal Ratio (Prime External Junior Risk Capital + Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital sourced via the EPI ratio still carries Senior Per Junior or SPJ capacity)
            - EJRC-via-SPJ (sourced by spending SPJ capacity; zero-SPJ-capacity thereafter)
            - Enabled Senior Risk Capital (SRC)
            - Total Senior Per Junior capacity
                ◦ Allocation of SPJ capacity to 1) enable SRC; or to 2) source EJRC
            - Prime-computed eligible Total Risk Capital (IJRC + EJRC-via-EPI + EJRC-via-SPJ + enabled SRC)
            - Official Aggregate RRC
            - Capital buffer = TRC – Aggregate RRC
            - Effective ratios
                ◦ EPI = EJRC-via-EPI ÷ IJRC
                ◦ SPJ utilisation:
                    ◦ enabled SRC ÷ total SPJ capacity
                    ◦ EJRC-via-SPJ ÷ total SPJ capacity    
◦ Dynamic Period Attestation and Disclosures: In addition to the end-of-period snapshot figures, the TRC Report must include an Attestation from the Prime Agent confirming it maintained TRC at or above its Aggregate RRC at all times throughout the entire reporting period. In addition, the TRC Report must include disclosure of any events, Prime-initiated off-chain contractual obligations, impairments to the value or redeemability of held assets (such as RWA backing or bridged asset viability), encumbrances, or other conditions that occurred at any point during the reporting period which materially affected its TRC, even if such conditions were temporary or not continuously visible to on-chain monitoring systems. This disclosure must include the nature of the event/condition, its precise timing and duration, and its quantified impact on the Prime Agent's TRC.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.3 - Sky Core TRC Monitoring And Verification Infrastructure [Core]  <!-- UUID: 18d692ce-7a5d-47a7-ada9-dc73abd87987 -->

The documents herein define infrastructure for TRC monitoring and verification.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.3.1 - Continuous Monitoring Of On-chain Verifiable Risk Capital (OVRC) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8048bdf0-84b7-4546-8f1a-98b62d073c84 -->

An autonomous monitoring system must be designed and implemented to enable continuous tracking of Prime Agents’ on-chain verifiable risk-capital components in near real-time. The on-chain, verifiable risk-capital components that can be tracked by such a monitoring system in real time are termed "On-chain Verifiable Risk Capital" (OVRC).

OVRC is not necessarily equivalent to Total Risk Capital (TRC).  A Prime Agent’s actual TRC cannot be determined definitively without accounting for off-chain agreements, encumbrances or other relevant conditions affecting capital eligibility or availability, which conditions must be disclosed in the TRC Reports submitted by Prime Agents. See [A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.2.3 - Primes’ TRC Report](41ca2085-d71b-47e5-8b1a-b183b6e2b6fc). 

Where the OVRC of a Prime Agent is less than its Aggregate RRC, the shortfall will be logged and penalty accrual will commence on a pro-rata, per-second basis for the duration and magnitude of the observed shortfall, according to the penalty schedule defined in the Atlas. Thus, this on-chain monitoring system serves as an interim penalty ledger.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.3.2 - Validation of TRC Report In General [Core]  <!-- UUID: 482fc286-9969-40cc-b3c9-6233ecbb659c -->

Prime Agents are required to submit periodic Total Risk Capital (TRC) Reports to Core GovOps. See [A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.2.3 - Primes’ TRC Report](41ca2085-d71b-47e5-8b1a-b183b6e2b6fc). The protocol for validation of Primes’ TRC reports is defined in the documents herein.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.3.2.1 - Core GovOps TRC Report Validation Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1ac3e606-f1c7-4a20-a9b6-a425920e98d3 -->

Core GovOps receives TRC Reports from Primes on a regular basis and must perform the following validation process.

Core GovOps verifies against the Atlas any Ecosystem Accord referenced in the TRC Report for sourced Prime-External Junior Risk Capital (SEJRC) or rented Originated Senior Risk Capital (OSRC). This includes confirming the existence, current validity, and terms of such Accords as formally recorded within the Atlas.

Core GovOps validates the Prime Agent's reported IJRC by reconciling the reported IJRC amount and its constituent asset composition against the actual on-chain state of the Prime Agent’s designated SubProxy account. This involves direct on-chain verification of asset balances. Core GovOps verifies that all assets reported as IJRC and held within the SubProxy account meet the definition of "eligible assets" for IJRC as defined by the Atlas. See [A.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1 - Internal Junior Risk Capital (IJRC)](8728abee-0dc5-449b-b4c2-78698da16f10). 

For reported Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital (TEJRC) and Originated Senior Risk Capital directly originated by the Prime, Core GovOps validates the reported amounts and statuses by cross-referencing data from the relevant smart contract systems. This may involve querying TEJRC pool contracts, OSRC auction records, and other on-chain infrastructure to confirm the existence, ownership, and eligibility of these capital components.

Core GovOps reviews all attestations and disclosures made by the Prime Agent in the TRC Report. This review focuses on understanding the Prime Agent's TRC compliance with Aggregate RRC throughout the entire reporting period. This assessment is critical for identifying intra-period shortfalls that might not be visible to on-chain monitoring systems or reflected in the end-of-period snapshot alone. The assessment process may include requiring the Prime Agent to provide supplementary documentation, verifiable evidence, or independent third-party confirmations for material off-chain claims or attestations concerning intra-period events; and/or cross-referencing disclosed off-chain information with relevant on-chain indicators or transactions that might corroborate or contradict the attestations.

Finally, Core GovOps independently calculates and verifies the Prime Agent's compliance with all Atlas-defined capital sourcing ratios (e.g., External Per Internal (EPI), Senior Per Junior (SPJ)).

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.3.3 - Finalized Determination Of TRC Position And Penalties [Core]  <!-- UUID: 36f3e675-d372-4d25-a50f-f0ba84a36273 -->

After reaching a definitive accounting of Prime Agents’ capital position and TRC adequacy, penalties are finalized by Core GovOps. This involves reconciling the interim penalty ledger (derived from the OVRC system) with the definitive TRC history, which incorporates all validated information from the TRC Report including any intra-period shortfalls.

If the validated TRC Report indicates that the Prime Agent's TRC was below its Aggregate RRC during the reporting period, and this actual shortfall was more severe than, or not detected by, the OVRC monitoring system, then penalties will be finalized as follows: if the OVRC system had already accrued penalties, these will be adjusted upwards to match the actual shortfall; if the OVRC system had not detected a shortfall, penalties will be assessed and applied retroactively based on the full duration and magnitude of the actual shortfall.
    
2. If the validated TRC Report confirms that TRC shortfalls were identical in duration and magnitude to those logged by the OVRC monitoring system throughout the reporting period: the penalties accrued in the interim penalty ledger will be confirmed and finalized.
    
3. If the validated TRC Report confirms that TRC was higher than a misleading OVRC reading during a specific portion of the reporting period which led to an erroneously logged penalty: Core GovOps will adjust or void the penalty accordingly.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.4 - Risk-Capital Incident Response [Core]  <!-- UUID: 12b7d480-68a0-4493-9534-d6915f86c112 -->

Where a Prime Agent’s Allocation System Instances are operationalized by its Operational Executor Agent, the management of and response to Required Risk Capital (RRC)-related incidents requires a defined framework within each Prime Agent's Artifact (the Multi-Instance Coordinator Document for the Allocation System Primitive) and its associated Executor Accord.

While the Prime Agent's strategic team ("Prime Team") determines the specific rectification strategy for an RRC incident—considering its holistic portfolio, prevailing market conditions, and the potential for strategic acceptance of penalties—this discretion is exercised subject to the authority of Sky Core to impose penalties and take corrective measures, up to and including the conservatorship of a Prime Agent, to protect the ecosystem and make any losses whole.

This document will be developed further in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.5 - Instance Operational Conformance [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1ec5f16f-194d-4163-b1ba-5c196ffa554b -->

Operational deviation from Artifact specifications can render an Instance’s RRC, and thus the Prime’s Aggregate RRC, invalid. Prime Agents must therefore ensure that each Allocation System Instance adheres to its respective Instance Configuration Document. Whether a Prime self-operationalizes its Allocation System or contracts with an Operational Executor Agent, its Agent Artifact must define processes for monitoring for, and addressing deviations of, Instance operational conformance. This document will be developed further in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.2 - Asset Liability Management [Core]  <!-- UUID: ed10830e-6b17-4117-8ab4-5ea388b518bb -->

On an ongoing basis, the Prime Agent team or Operational GovOps operates the Allocation Instance, scaling exposure up and down. Any change to the Allocation Instance outside of the limits specified in the Prime Agent Artifact or requiring judgment on the part of Operational GovOps (where the Allocation System Instance is operationalized by the Operational Executor Agent) requires a new vote of Prime Agent token holders. See [A.2.2.9.1.1.3.3.1 - Modification Of Existing Instances](c1b5708c-e88f-45e0-92e1-b76e68b34f13). As part of monthly and quarterly settlement cycles, Core GovOps reviews yields and obligations, applying penalties retroactively for any previously undisclosed violations. In the event of any such violations, Operational GovOps may be required to take escalatory steps based on the fallback strategy in the Prime Agent Artifact.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.3.1 - Modification Of Existing Instances [Core]  <!-- UUID: c1b5708c-e88f-45e0-92e1-b76e68b34f13 -->

When a Prime Agent wishes to modify an existing Allocation System Primitive Instance in a manner that cannot be accommodated by the existing operational parameters defined in its Agent Artifact, the Prime Agent must initiate an Artifact Edit Proposal process as detailed herein.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.3.1.1 - Conditions Requiring Artifact Edit Proposal [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3db4c73f-f480-4da4-9af3-8ecedd89e166 -->

An Artifact Edit Proposal is mandatory for an Instance modification under the following conditions:

1. a desired modification to the Instance's operational parameters falls outside the pre-defined operational ranges codified in the respective Instance Configuration Document or other applicable Artifact Documents; or

2. a desired modification, even if notionally within defined ranges in the Artifact, is determined by Operational GovOps to materially alter the Instance's risk profile in a way that could invalidate the underlying Capital and Operational Plan and, consequently, the premises driving the current Required Risk Capital (RRC) for that Instance. Operational GovOps retains the discretion to require an Artifact Edit Proposal if a proposed change, regardless of its fit within existing operational ranges, is determined to pose a material change to the assessed risk.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.3.1.2 - Revision of Capital and Operational Plan for Instance Modification [Core]  <!-- UUID: 235a7317-ef29-48ed-a37f-5892108f8dc8 -->

Prior to submitting an Artifact Edit Proposal for an Instance modification, the Prime Agent must revise the Capital and Operational Plan (C&O Plan) associated with that Instance to reflect the desired new state.

The revised Capital and Operational Plan for an Instance modification must include the following information:
    
1. Updates to the Instance's strategy and operational parameters;
    
2. A new pro-forma Required Risk Capital (RRC) estimate specifically calculated to reflect the Instance's proposed modified state;  and
    
3. A revised notional Total Risk Capital (TRC) coverage strategy, detailing how the Prime Agent will manage any changes to the Instance RRC and the consequential impact on its Aggregate RRC, including plans for acquiring additional JRC or SRC if necessary.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.3.1.3 - Governance Process for Instance Modification [Core]  <!-- UUID: aee1d848-eee8-4590-a596-1884efcb474a -->

The Prime Agent's revised Capital and Operational Plan forms the core of the Artifact Edit Proposal for the Instance modification. This proposal must be submitted to the Operational Executor Facilitator for review. The Facilitator assesses the proposal for completeness and general alignment. Following this review, the proposal is subjected to the Prime Agent's governance process for approval to edit the Agent Artifact, typically involving a token holder vote as defined in the Prime Agent's Root Edit Primitive.

###### A.2.2.9.1.1.3.3.1.4 - Post-Approval Integration and RRC Update [Core]  <!-- UUID: e3a00c33-9da7-4fa9-80ff-55d3a70100fa -->

If the Artifact Edit Proposal for the Instance modification is approved through the Prime Agent's governance process, the relevant content from the revised Capital and Operational Plan is formally integrated into the respective Instance Configuration Document within the Prime Agent's Artifact. Once the modified Instance is operational under its new, approved parameters and its data is integrated into the ecosystem's monitoring systems, its adjusted Required Risk Capital (RRC) will be officially determined and tracked via the Sky Core RRC Dashboard/API. This official RRC figure then supersedes the Prime-prepared pro-forma RRC that was part of the modification proposal.

###### A.2.3.1.2.1.2.2 - Internal Senior Risk Capital Income [Core]  <!-- UUID: 02b5422a-093d-4e21-86ff-5cfcd5af8ed5 -->

Internal Senior Risk Capital income is the revenue attributed to Sky from the total payments made by Primes for Originated Senior Risk Capital (OSRC). ISRC itself comprises surplus capital allocated from designated buffers funded by the Sky Treasury Management Function. While Primes pay a single clearing price for their OSRC based on the monthly Origination Process, the total revenue received by Sky is subsequently allocated proportionally, with the portion corresponding to ISRC's share of the Total Senior Risk Capital (TSRC) pool designated as ISRC Income. See [A.2.3.1.3 - Sourcing Of Internal Senior Risk Capital From Surplus Buffers](ac7a6636-acbc-40c9-abc1-4543c0beb300).

##### A.2.3.1.2.4 - Step 3: Stability Capital Retention [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5ece5d43-8d6c-41ab-9b90-b8778f325909 -->

A percentage of the Step 3 Capital equal to the Stability Capital Retention ("SCR") is allocated to funding the Stability Capital Buffer. The remaining percentage becomes Step 4 Capital.

###### A.2.3.1.2.4.1 - Stability Capital Buffer [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9655da22-1940-481f-a8fc-e202ab09b7b8 -->

The Stability Capital Buffer is the surplus of the Sky Protocol that is able to be the final absorber of losses in the case of unsuccessful liquidation of failed Prime Agents. See [A.3.5.1 - Surplus Buffer](9782cdc5-c274-45c2-bf4a-690f22c6a294).

###### A.2.3.1.2.4.2 - Stability Capital Retention [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6bb2c75a-ff51-4846-9d99-c0456b2d8cf8 -->

The Stability Capital Retention (`SCR`) is calculated according to the following formula:

`SCR = (1 - ((SCB / TS) / TSCB)) * RF`.

Where:
◦ SCB = Current Stability Capital Buffer,
◦ TS = Total USDS supply,
◦ TSCB = Target Stability Capital Buffer,
◦ RF = Retention Factor.

This formula dynamically adjusts capital retention based on the current buffer status:
1. When SCB/TS equals TSCB (buffer at target), SCR equals zero.
2. When SCB/TS is below TSCB, SCR increases proportionally to the shortfall.
3. The maximum possible retention is capped by the Retention Factor (RF).

This ensures that capital retention automatically scales with urgency - the further the Stability Capital Buffer falls below its target percentage of total supply, the greater the portion of capital retained.

The parameters for calculating the `SCR` are further defined in the documents herein.

###### A.2.3.1.2.4.2.1 - Current Stability Capital Buffer [Core]  <!-- UUID: 119eb3d9-6b14-42aa-86a6-e1ba2275c912 -->

The Current Stability Capital Buffer (`SCB`) is the current level of the Stability Capital Buffer.

###### A.2.3.1.2.4.2.2 - Total USDS Supply [Core]  <!-- UUID: e95c6308-c620-45af-be27-7bac5ad12889 -->

The total USDS Supply (`TS`) is the total supply of USDS.

###### A.2.3.1.2.4.2.3 - Target Stability Capital Buffer [Core]  <!-- UUID: eda13fef-866d-4b0f-955c-06105ba86d86 -->

The Target Stability Capital Buffer (`TSCB`) is the Target level of the Stability Capital Buffer, expressed as a percentage of the total supply of USDS. It is calculated according to the following formula:

`TCSB = 0.75% + (TS * 1.4e-14)`.

The `TSCB` cannot exceed 5%.

This formula begins with a Target Stability Capital Buffer of 0.75% and gradually increases this as the Total USDS Supply increases, reflecting the fact that a greater capital buffer is required as USDS becomes more systemically important.

For example, with USDS Supply of 8 billion, the Target Stability Capital Buffer would be approximately 0.76%.

###### A.2.3.1.2.4.2.4 - Retention Factor [Core]  <!-- UUID: 14646a34-1c61-4927-98df-a429e7293be2 -->

The Retention Factor is a factor representing how aggressively capital should be retained to fund the Stability Capital Buffer. It is calculated according to the following formula:

`RF = 25% + (TS * 1.6e-13)`.

The `RF` cannot exceed 75%.

The Retention Factor starts at 25% and scales upward with Total USDS Supply, recognizing that capital accumulation becomes more critical as USDS gains in systemic importance.

For example, with USDS Supply of 8 billion, the Retention Factor would be approximately 26%.

##### A.2.3.1.2.5 - Step 4: Smart Burn And Standard Activity Staking Rewards [Core]  <!-- UUID: 99d40e56-7433-4abd-9674-7783627feec0 -->

###### A.2.3.1.2.5.1.1 - Purpose [Core]  <!-- UUID: e95b1080-5b70-4941-9025-0269ae2680fb -->

The Smart Burn Engine uses the Smart Burn Buffer to buy and burn SKY using an intelligent algorithm, buying more when the price is low and retaining capital when the price is high to buy later at favorable prices.

###### A.2.3.1.2.5.1.2 - Usage Of Smart Burn Buffer [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7295761a-e72b-4b32-9345-b229b46566d1 -->

The Smart Burn Engine only buys and burns SKY when the Market Capitalization (`MC`) is below the Target Market Capitalization (`TMC`). The percentage of the Smart Burn Buffer (`Burn Rate`) that is used to buy and burn SKY each Monthly Settlement Cycle is calculated according to the following formula:

`Burn Rate = (1 - MC / TMC) * 50%`.

The parameters for calculating the `Burn Rate` are defined in the documents herein.

Conceptually, this formula buys more SKY the further the Market Capitalization is below the Target Market Capitalization.

###### A.2.3.1.2.5.1.2.1 - Target Market Capitalization [Core]  <!-- UUID: 86b0554d-4f34-412f-9519-448e9602aa2e -->

The Target Market Capitalization (`TMC`) is calculated according to the following formula:

`TMC = 8.5 + (200 * growth_rate) * annual_profits`.

The `growth_rate` is the three (3) year moving average historical growth rate of Net Revenue, and `annual_profits` is the one (1) year moving average of Net Revenue.

Conceptually, this formula calculates a target price based on the current earnings of the Sky Protocol and a price to earnings ratio, where the price to earnings ratio is a function of how quickly the Sky Protocol is growing.

###### A.2.3.1.2.5.1.2.1.1 - Continuous Improvement [Core]  <!-- UUID: 194d3ec8-3cb7-48ec-9ab4-5d2cd98c80a7 -->

The Core Executor Agents must continuously improve the Target Market Capitalization formula so that the Smart Burn Engine becomes more efficient over time.

###### A.2.3.1.2.5.1.2.2 - Market Capitalization [Core]  <!-- UUID: 59ea0f2f-5fb6-48fb-87cd-e43d50bc110b -->

The Market Capitalization is the current market capitalization of Sky. It is calculated by multiplying the price of SKY by the total supply of SKY, treating each MKR on an as-converted basis based on the conversion ratio of 24,000 SKY to 1 MKR.

###### A.2.3.1.2.5.2 - Standard Activity Staking Rewards [Core]  <!-- UUID: 67fcd852-0de4-4a16-af84-adce61bf54bd -->

20% of Step 4 Capital is allocated to the Standard Activity Staking Rewards Buffer, as specified in the documents herein.

###### A.2.3.1.2.5.2.1 - Purpose [Core]  <!-- UUID: 46e90503-0b49-4b29-b3e5-93c8fa5907ea -->

Standard Activity Staking Rewards (SASR) provide rewards to users who contribute to security by staking and delegating their SKY votes at least once.

###### A.2.3.1.2.5.2.2 - Payout From Standard Activity Staking Rewards Buffer [Core]  <!-- UUID: e288b944-759e-4d30-8db7-b59de7b5f912 -->

The Standard Activity Staking Reward Distribution occurs linearly over the course of each month. The monthly payout from the Standard Activity Staking Rewards Buffer (SASRB) is equal to the lesser of (1) 20% of Step 4 Capital, or (2) 15% of the SASRB, with a minimum floor of 5% of the SASRB.

In periods of high profitability, funds build up in the Standard Activity Staking Rewards Buffer. Then in periods of low profitability these funds are paid out from the Standard Activity Staking Rewards Buffer, ensuring that there is a continued incentive for involvement in governance even in periods of low profitability to maintain security.

###### A.2.3.1.2.5.2.3 - Standard Activity Staker Qualification [Core]  <!-- UUID: a22d900a-d15c-41f0-af90-eec23112dcb6 -->

## A.2.4 - Sky Core Monthly Settlement Cycle [Article]  <!-- UUID: 6f8d5065-d6ff-4add-9a28-eadeffa7ed1a -->

This Article governs the Sky Core Monthly Settlement Cycle (MSC), a recurring process that synchronizes core financial operations, governance functions, and risk management activities across the ecosystem.

### A.2.4.1 - Monthly Settlement Cycle Overview [Section]  <!-- UUID: e0d89c66-5bab-402e-82a2-6270f1bcac07 -->

The documents herein define the Monthly Settlement Cycle (MSC), a standardized, system-wide process executed at the end of each calendar month.

#### A.2.4.1.1 - Operational Processes [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7f43aea7-9b81-48ef-b3ce-fdfae7e8a551 -->

The Monthly Settlement Cycle (MSC) synchronizes several key operational processes across the ecosystem, including:
    
1. Sky Protocol’s net revenue from the previous month is calculated and allocated through the steps of the Treasury Management Function. See [A.2.3 - Treasury Management](6c0af059-5d33-4e2b-90f1-1606957b8f85). 
   
2. The monthly Senior Risk Capital (SRC) origination process is settled: the clearing price is established, costs are deducted from winning Prime Agents’ accounts, and their accounts are credited with Originated SRC (OSRC) for the upcoming month. See [A.3.2.2.4.3.5 - Settlement Of Origination](fff0112a-58dd-4041-97f9-7baf113b4e70). 
    
3. Queued conversions between USDS and srUSDS within the SRC system are processed. See [A.3.2.2.4.2.2 - Deposit And Redemption Queues](38a99586-4a13-4ce3-8b2f-cee025e0c390). 
    
4. Pioneer Incentive Pools are funded with an amount equivalent to the Sky Savings Rate multiplied by the balance of Unrewarded USDS. See [A.2.2.8.3 - Pioneer Chain Primitive](4c7be4c6-44b5-407a-94ae-3d7ca7e8039c). 
    
5. The Smart Burn Buffer's burning operation occurs synchronously with each Monthly Settlement Cycle. At each cycle, the system calculates the appropriate Burn Rate based on current market conditions and executes the burn operation, if applicable, according to the formula specified in the Atlas. See [A.2.3.1.2.5.1.2 - Usage Of Smart Burn Buffer](7295761a-e72b-4b32-9345-b229b46566d1). 
    
6. Critical Core GovOps functions related to the operationalization of Sky Primitives are executed, including payment/reimbursement processing, compliance monitoring, and the calculation and application of retroactive penalties.

#### A.2.4.1.2 - Implementation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 75473c4b-69ba-4e6b-bbf6-2c926732364c -->

The documents herein define the initial implementation of the Monthly Settlement Cycle. This initial implementation of the Monthly Settlement Cycle does not include the Senior Risk Capital System, which is still being developed, and funds continue to be allocated through the modified Treasury Management Function. See [A.2.3.1.4 - Short Term Transitionary Measures](a0186d71-d5f6-4643-a5c5-8fcf6c2625f8).

##### A.2.4.1.2.1 - Process Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: dd25aba4-7b77-469e-beb2-feaaedbbf143 -->

The documents herein define the initial process for performing the Monthly Settlement Cycle. The calculations to be performed as part of the Monthly Settlement Cycle are defined in [A.2.4.1.2.2 - Implementation Stages](cf1d76c1-fc9f-499d-866f-265276e421f0). This process definition specifies who performs the calculations and how funds are ultimately paid out.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.1 - Forum Post By Core GovOps [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5122086f-a067-4898-bcd2-bfba4ca3d795 -->

By the end of each month, Core GovOps creates a post on the Sky Forum to organize all communications regarding the Monthly Settlement Cycle for that month (the "Monthly Settlement Cycle Post"). The post must be made under the "Sky Core" category using the `monthly-settlement-cycle` tag.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.2 - Calculations By Operational Executor Agents And Core Council Risk Advisor [Core]  <!-- UUID: e9f6226e-656c-4290-a329-d745f45323ba -->

Within seven (7) calendar days of the end of each month, each Operational Executor Agent and the Core Council Risk Advisor replies to the Monthly Settlement Cycle Post with their calculation of the net amounts due to or from Prime Agents as specified in the documents herein.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.2.1 - Initial Calculation By Operational Executor Agent [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7f209f46-72c6-42f7-a7ad-898190ff4e6f -->

Within seven (7) calendar days of the end of each month, each Operational Executor Agent replies to the Monthly Settlement Cycle Post with a calculation of the net amounts due to or from the Prime Agents that it has an Executor Accord with (the "Initial Calculation"). The Initial Calculation must contain reasonable supporting detail. The required contents of the Initial Calculation will be further specified in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.2.1.1 - Demand Side Stablecoin Primitive Recipients [Core]  <!-- UUID: f62602a6-1c1a-44d4-9c9f-a903ce433330 -->

For each Prime Agent, the Initial Calculation must specify whether payments with respect to Demand Side Stablecoin Primitives (see [A.2.2.8 - Demand Side Stablecoin Primitives](26415305-432d-423b-9553-3f325279712d)) have already been made by the Operational Executor Agent, and thus should be reimbursed to the Operational Executor Agent instead of being paid to the Prime Agent.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.2.2 - Independent Calculation By Core Council Risk Advisor On Behalf Of Core Council [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8be8ae66-2453-4d7d-8880-ffaba36bdb7e -->

Within seven (7) calendar days of the end of each month, the Core Council Risk Advisor replies to the Monthly Settlement Cycle Post with their own independent calculation of the net amounts due to or from each Prime Agent (the "Independent Calculation"). The Independent Calculation should also include calculation of the amounts to be transferred to the Core Council and Aligned Delegates Buffers (see [A.2.3.1.4.1 - Allocation Of Step 1 Capital](76eab64d-a5ba-4f3c-a295-bde0e444d0df)). The Independent Calculation must contain reasonable supporting detail. The required contents of the Independent Calculation will be further specified in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.3 - Final Calculation By Core GovOps [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9de89bf3-9051-44f1-9ec0-d362ee4d4b38 -->

Within twelve (12) calendar days of the end of each month, Core GovOps replies to the Monthly Settlement Cycle Post with the final calculation of the net amounts due to or from each Prime Agent (the "Final Calculation"). The Final Calculation should also include the final amounts to be transferred to the Core Council and Aligned Delegates Buffers (see [A.2.3.1.4.1 - Allocation Of Step 1 Capital](76eab64d-a5ba-4f3c-a295-bde0e444d0df)). If there are any Disputed Amounts (see [A.2.4.1.2.1.3.2 - Disputed Amount](4ddda7cd-9942-4f60-9555-6b3f16770334)), then Core GovOps must resolve them. Core GovOps must work with the relevant Operational Executor Agent, relevant Prime Agents, and the Core Council Risk Advisor to reach a mutually acceptable resolution and may consult other parties to the extent it deems advisable.

Core GovOps makes the final decision in resolving differences between the Initial Calculation and the Independent Calculation. The Final Calculation must specify the Final Amount and contain reasonable supporting detail. The required contents of the Final Calculation will be further specified in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.3.1 - Agreed Amount [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8669ef42-d55b-4be8-839e-646b4ff17e4c -->

The net amount due to or from a Prime Agent in an Initial Calculation is an Agreed Amount if the absolute value of the percentage difference between the amounts in the Initial Calculation and the Independent Calculation is less than or equal to the Allowed Deviation (see [A.2.4.1.2.1.3.3 - Allowed Deviation](2e471685-fec5-4306-8747-a50dbbdd5c70)). The net amount due to or from a Prime Agent in an Independent Calculation is also an Agreed Amount if there is no Initial Calculation.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.3.2 - Disputed Amount [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4ddda7cd-9942-4f60-9555-6b3f16770334 -->

The net amount due to or from a Prime Agent in an Initial Calculation is a Disputed Amount if it is not an Agreed Amount.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.3.3 - Allowed Deviation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2e471685-fec5-4306-8747-a50dbbdd5c70 -->

The Allowed Deviation is the maximum allowed deviation, on a percentage basis, between the net amount due to or from a Prime Agent in the Initial Calculation and Independent Calculation before resolution of these differences is required. It recognizes that if the Initial Calculation and Independent Calculation are truly developed independently then differences in methodology are likely to result in small deviations.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.3.3.1 - Allowed Deviation Current Value [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0d2f4cb2-815a-4b0c-9bca-3a0d2635effc -->

The current value of the Allowed Deviation is 1%.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.3.4 - Final Amount [Core]  <!-- UUID: c20c38fe-c952-4e75-86fe-d6b561f7f436 -->

The net amount due to or from a Prime Agent in a Final Calculation is a Final Amount.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.3.5 - Disputes By Prime Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: c204b363-7cc0-4e40-a7dc-68de57358cf9 -->

A Prime Agent may dispute the calculation of the net amount due to or from it (a "Dispute Notice"). The Dispute Notice must be posted as a reply to the Monthly Settlement Cycle Post within five (5) calendar days of the posting of the Initial Calculation or Independent Calculation being disputed. The Dispute Notice must specify the errors in the Initial Calculation or Independent Calculation and the Prime’s own calculation of the net amount due to or from it. The required contents of the Dispute Notice will be further specified in a future iteration of the Atlas.

Core GovOps may at its discretion resolve the differences between the calculations using the process specified in [A.2.4.1.2.1.3 - Final Calculation By Core GovOps](9de89bf3-9051-44f1-9ec0-d362ee4d4b38). Alternatively, Core GovOps may elect to determine the correct amount and true up any differences in the next Monthly Settlement Cycle as specified in [A.2.4.1.2.1.5 - True Up In Subsequent Monthly Settlement Cycle](de1592f5-dbce-46de-913f-6ec9589d36e8). In either case Core GovOps must post its decision as a reply to the Dispute Notice.

###### A.2.4.1.2.1.4 - Settlement Through Sky Core Executive Vote [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0d561ea6-8689-459c-85eb-7c861553e116 -->

###### A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1 - Instance Profit [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9974c452-216b-45c0-8a1d-621816b8da2a -->

Instance Profit for an Allocation System Instance is equal to the greater of (1) Instance Revenue (see [A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.1.1 - Instance Revenue](90acccd5-d7b4-4c03-9ce2-471dc3e82c98)) minus Instance Expenses (see [A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1 - Instance Expense](6cbe7181-419f-4a7b-a659-85972d5100a3)) and (2) zero.

###### A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.1.1 - Instance Expense [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6cbe7181-419f-4a7b-a659-85972d5100a3 -->

Instance Expense for an Allocation System Instance for a month is the interest expense on the funds from Sky’s Collateral Portfolio invested in the Instance. It is calculated on a per block basis based on the amount invested from Sky’s Collateral Portfolio and the Agent Credit Line Borrow Rate.

###### A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.3 - Step 3: Calculate Adjusted Allocation System Profit [Core]  <!-- UUID: a9427e1a-77ae-473b-aafd-b4216fcd615c -->

Third, Adjusted Allocation System Profit is calculated for each Prime for the month. Adjusted Allocation System Profit for a Prime in a month is Total Allocation System Profit minus the Distortion Penalty (see [A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.3.1 - Distortion Penalty](2a021208-c964-440f-b491-3c9e034f2d22)) and the Low Yield Actively Stabilizing Collateral Penalty (see [A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.3.2 - Low Yield Actively Stabilizing Collateral Penalty](631e7c75-375f-4298-9d85-b17cb2eb019f)).

###### A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.3.1 - Distortion Penalty [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2a021208-c964-440f-b491-3c9e034f2d22 -->

The Distortion Penalty is a discretionary penalty designed to mitigate the potential misalignment caused by the asymmetric nature of the Simplified Profit And Loss Calculation, where Primes earn profits on Allocation System Instances that earn more than the Agent Credit Line Borrow Rate but do not suffer losses when Instances earn less than the Agent Credit Line Borrow Rate.

The Core Executor Agents, in consultation with the Core Council Risk Advisor, may assess a penalty of up to 100% of Total Allocation System Profit (see [A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.2 - Step 2: Calculate Total Allocation System Profit](1eaa2350-e354-4000-baa6-be250853bddc)) if it determines that a Prime’s decisions were distorted by this incentive structure.

###### A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.3.2 - Low Yield Actively Stabilizing Collateral Penalty [Core]  <!-- UUID: 631e7c75-375f-4298-9d85-b17cb2eb019f -->

The Low Yield Actively Stabilizing Collateral Penalty is a formulaic penalty designed to prevent Primes from holding excessive amounts of low yield Actively Stabilizing Collateral.

The penalty, as a percentage of the Total Allocation System Profit, is the lesser of (1) ten times the Excess Low Yield Actively Stabilizing Collateral Percentage and (2) 100%.

###### A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.3.2.1 - Excess Low Yield Actively Stabilizing Collateral Percentage [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5e78fb21-1208-442f-b215-3babcd69fd69 -->

The Excess Low Yield Actively Stabilizing Collateral Percentage for a Prime is equal to the excess of (1) its Low Yield Actively Stabilizing Collateral (see [A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.3.2 - Low Yield Actively Stabilizing Collateral Penalty](631e7c75-375f-4298-9d85-b17cb2eb019f)) as a percentage of its Collateral Portfolio above (2) its Minimum Actively Stabilizing Collateral (see [A.3.3.2.2 - Minimum Actively Stabilizing Collateral](475fe222-9e4a-4e9d-9be6-a7a424ce02f8)) as a percentage of its Collateral Portfolio.

###### A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.3.2.1.1 - Low Yield Actively Stabilizing Collateral [Core]  <!-- UUID: 858b2ee0-89b8-4505-8324-f3cd315de40c -->

Low Yield Actively Stabilizing Collateral is Actively Stabilizing Collateral (see [A.3.3.2.2.1.1 - Resting Actively Stabilizing Collateral](0e17b35a-c830-4695-b63c-5ef58b249d3f)) that earns less than the Agent Credit Line Borrow Rate.

###### A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.4 - Step 4: Calculate Amount Due To Sky With Respect To Supply Side Primitives [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2617edae-6c22-4d7c-8e14-353bfced35f2 -->

Fourth, the amount due to Sky with respect to Supply Side Primitives is calculated for each Prime for the month. The amount due to Sky with respect to Supply Side Primitives is Total Allocation System Revenue (see [A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.1 - Step 1: Calculate Total Allocation System Revenue](fd3ea856-dbef-4fe0-a662-82a58d33d9c0)) minus Adjusted Allocation System Profit (see [A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2.3 - Step 3: Calculate Adjusted Allocation System Profit](a9427e1a-77ae-473b-aafd-b4216fcd615c)).

###### A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.3 - Settlement [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6dcd7515-3398-443a-9377-99e0c3cd0174 -->

The amounts due from Sky to each Prime with respect to Demand Side Primitives and the Agent Rate (see [A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.1 - Amount Due From Sky To Primes With Respect To Demand Side Primitives And Agent Rate](33d1b516-d347-4d44-9af6-95f25e8a8d8c)) and the amounts due from each Prime to Sky with respect to Supply Side Primitives (see [A.2.4.1.2.2.1.1.2 - Amount Due From Prime To Sky With Respect To Supply Side Primitives](e98ddd17-a8c3-4523-8464-cc41247c66e8)) are settled as specified in [A.2.4.1.2.1.4 - Settlement Through Sky Core Executive Vote](0d561ea6-8689-459c-85eb-7c861553e116).

In Stage 2 of the implementation of the Monthly Settlement Cycle, the net amount due from each Prime to Sky is calculated as specified in the Atlas without the use of the Simplified Profit And Loss Calculation. However, interest under the Base Rate does not accrue in real time onchain and is instead calculated offchain and paid through Executive Votes as part of the Monthly Settlement Cycle. This is known as the Virtual Base Rate as these calculations occur offchain.

###### A.2.4.1.2.2.2.2 - Stage 2 Timing [Core]  <!-- UUID: ceb3c433-d73f-4c58-bac9-e79b44e66fcf -->

Stage 2 will be implemented in the December 2025 Monthly Settlement Cycle for the period from November 1, 2025 to November 30, 2025. If there is no December 2025 Monthly Settlement Cycle, then Stage 2 will be implemented in the January 2026 Monthly Settlement Cycle for the period from November 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025.

###### A.2.7.1.2.1.1 - General Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 63701dcb-d885-4f81-a67b-71f5bf67bde8 -->

This document defines the requirements generally applicable to all Ecosystem Communication Channels.

Responsible moderators are granted the prerogative to ban users from the communication channels for which they are responsible when they deem users to be acting in a misaligned fashion. Misalignment can include maliciously exploiting the communication channel or disrupting its efficient functioning through improper use or antisocial behavior.

However, unless egregiously misaligned or disrupting behavior takes place, responsible moderators should err on the side of charity and issue a public warning for users who engage in bad behavior before resorting to banning them. Egregiously misaligned or disrupting behavior includes spamming, flooding, threatening, or using inappropriate or abusive language.

Only the Core Facilitator may ban a user from the Sky Forum when doing so would operationally block an ongoing governance process (e.g. the user has submitted an otherwise eligible governance proposal).

###### A.2.7.1.2.1.1.1 - Public Communication Of Bans [Core]  <!-- UUID: d18821e4-cee6-41d0-91fb-b5bb963b2594 -->

The documents herein define the requirements regarding public communication of bans. The Sky Forum is subject to special requirements that are defined in [A.2.7.1.2.1.1.1.1 - Sky Forum-Specific Requirements](a3e4d767-56d1-4b1f-8ade-b733bca4244f). Requirements applicable to all other Ecosystem Communication Channels are defined in [A.2.7.1.2.1.1.1.2 - Requirements Applicable To All Other Channels](d64ffda4-097c-47f8-b497-f20e7456b7fa).

###### A.2.7.1.2.1.1.1.1 - Sky Forum-Specific Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: a3e4d767-56d1-4b1f-8ade-b733bca4244f -->

For the Sky Forum, the Core Facilitator must publicly communicate the ban and the reasons for banning a user if the ban interrupts the users' exercise of a governance process.

In all other cases involving the Sky Forum, responsible moderators may exercise their best judgment in determining whether to publicly communicate a ban and the reasons for a ban. In doing so, the responsible moderators should consider the importance of transparency and community awareness as well as whether the banned user has engaged in egregiously misaligned and disrupting behavior. In every case, the moderators must still use the built-in forum functionality to register the ban reason for every banned user so that all forum users can see it when visiting the forum profile of the banned user.

If it is assessed that a public communication is necessary, the Core Facilitator is responsible for writing and publishing it.

###### A.2.7.1.2.1.1.1.2 - Requirements Applicable To All Other Channels [Core]  <!-- UUID: d64ffda4-097c-47f8-b497-f20e7456b7fa -->

For all Ecosystem Communication Channels other than the Sky Forum, the responsible moderators may exercise their discretion in determining whether to publicly communicate a ban and the reasons for the ban.

###### A.2.7.1.2.1.1.2 - Use Of Automated Tools [Core]  <!-- UUID: 76247105-be57-4eac-9eb4-793947a43d67 -->

Responsible moderators may use automated tools, including AI and bots, to help fulfill their moderation responsibilities. The responsible moderators retain responsibility for ensuring that these tools conform to moderation policies and must establish a process through which automated decisions can be reviewed by the responsible moderators.

###### A.2.7.1.2.1.1.3 - Unbanning [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4d4a1d9a-c8c7-4c2b-aaec-33e382790d52 -->

Bannings are by default permanent. However, Ranked Delegates can propose the unbanning of users by publishing a forum post that states the handle(s) of the user(s) whose unbanning they request and the rationale for their unbanning. The forum post must tag the Core Facilitator, who will in turn prepare a binary Weekly Cycle Governance Poll to be published on the Voting Portal as soon as reasonably possible. The outcome of the Governance Poll is binding.

Where identity can be proven, the ban on unbanned users will be lifted across all communication channels.

###### A.2.7.1.2.1.1.4 - Intrinsic Limitations [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9e2d25b0-227c-4f08-a466-c99dc7243d92 -->

Given the digital nature of these communication channels and the consequent practical unenforceability of permanent bannings, responsible moderators are expected to have to deal with recurring banned users under new aliases. Responsible moderators must exercise best judgement when suspecting a user to be a banned user under a different guise and when assessing whether they pose a risk of recidivism.

##### A.2.7.1.2.2 - List of Responsible Moderators [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1f76a652-0958-4165-8183-51c9eaccdbaa -->

###### A.2.8.2.1.2.4.1 - DeFi Opportunities Right of First Refusal Duration [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0db1525d-bcce-469a-b414-65b41669432d -->

Grove provides the Spark Agent a right of first refusal for pursuing cross-chain bootstrapping opportunities, which lasts four weeks after notification by Grove. If Spark does not wish to deploy SparkLend or provide capital to the protocol in question, Grove retains the right to pursue the opportunity pending security and risk assessments of the target protocol. Upon written notification from Grove of a new DeFi opportunity via a communications channel mutually agreed by the parties, Spark has four weeks to decide whether it wants to deploy SparkLend or lend to the target chain and protocol. If Spark opts not to do so by the end of the four-week period, Grove is permitted to pursue the opportunity.

_Example:__ A lending protocol (i.e. Aave, Euler, Morpho, etc) plans on deploying on blockchain X. Grove provides written notification to Spark about the potential new deployment. Spark evaluates the opportunity and decides there are better opportunities to pursue. The opportunity reverts to Grove after Spark’s refusal; or, if Spark does not issue a formal refusal, the opportunity reverts to Grove after four weeks._

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.4.1 - Distribution Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: d3dd498e-fddd-4000-9fc2-10263ebc85cd -->

To ensure continuous ecosystem support over the period of years 10 to 30, Prime Agents must distribute either 0.5% of the market capitalization of their token per year, if distributed in tokens; or 0.6% of their market capitalization of their token per year if paid in stablecoins as a fee. These amounts include both the Standard Annual Upkeep Payment as set out in [A.2.8.2.2.2.4.2.1 - Standard Annual Upkeep Payment](5366c204-9fde-41b1-a8a4-ab6920c28b01) and the Additional Incremental Upkeep Payment as set out in[ ](https://atlas-axis.notion.site/Additional-Incremental-Upkeep-Payment-Core-If-a-Star-Agent-elects-not-to-distribute-certain-fund-1fdf2ff08d73802c804adcf401e7d66f#1fdf2ff08d73814ba4ffc4c497133102)[A.2.8.2.2.2.4.2.2 - Additional Incremental Upkeep Payment](2e7346bb-68bb-4441-8ff9-0fc17f7433f1).

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.4.2 - Distribution Structure [Core]  <!-- UUID: eb52fb46-f477-4bf1-afd3-7e4e13f19e8a -->

To ensure continued ecosystem support, Primes, including Spark and Grove, are required to make annual upkeep payments to Sky, calculated based on retained funds as set out in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.4.2.1 - Standard Annual Upkeep Payment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5366c204-9fde-41b1-a8a4-ab6920c28b01 -->

All Prime Agents will pay a standard annual upkeep payment of 25 basis points (bps) (0.25%) per year. This standard upkeep payment applies permanently and is separate from any additional payments explained below.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.4.2.2 - Additional Incremental Upkeep Payment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2e7346bb-68bb-4441-8ff9-0fc17f7433f1 -->

If a Prime Agent elects not to distribute certain funds to Sky, but instead retains those funds in its treasury, the Prime incurs an additional incremental upkeep payment. The incremental payment is calculated based on the total retained funds at the rate of 2.5 basis points (bps) (0.025%) per year per $1 million retained, if the payment is made in tokens. If the payment is made in cash (USD) rather than tokens, the incremental payment increases by 20%. This results in a rate of 3 basis points (bps) (0.03%) per year per $1 million retained.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.5 - Genesis Capital Allocation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 23149a25-19a1-4d8f-b4ce-ea4b2adc2e21 -->

All components of code that form part of the Prime Protocols (i.e. Spark and Grove) will be open source.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.6.3 - Financial Strategies [Core]  <!-- UUID: eb550b0a-3ffc-4a86-b8fe-9cc1f60f2a7e -->

The financial strategies implemented by the Prime Foundations (i.e. the Spark Foundation and Grove Foundation) will be closed source. Operational specifics are further defined in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.6.3.1 - Role Of Prime Foundation [Core]  <!-- UUID: ec0b206a-bf87-4ca8-aa7f-aa4ca1bc80f8 -->

The Prime Foundation (i.e. the Spark Foundation and Grove Foundation) will retain ownership of the code and strategies that determine how capital is allocated for its Prime. They will contract with the Development Company for the development and execution of the strategies.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.6.3.2 - Role Of Development Company [Core]  <!-- UUID: d88e4c91-cce4-4f95-a989-ea876ccdf99b -->

The Development Company for each Prime Agent will execute the strategy and relay the results to the Operational Executor Agent.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.6.3.3 - Role Of Operational Executor Agent [Core]  <!-- UUID: b0fc4a02-f41c-4556-b3f5-84d262ca00f2 -->

The relevant Operational Executor Agent, which is already engaged to the Prime in question, will conduct a principled compatibility analysis to ensure the strategy aligns with the Sky Atlas and the relevant Prime Artifact. Once validated, the Operational Executor Agent executes the capital allocation in question.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.6.3.4 - Prime Tokenholder Governance Rights [Core]  <!-- UUID: 63717bcd-4696-4104-a368-eac839a7ba2b -->

To ensure accountability, Prime token holders will retain governance rights, including the ability to revoke the Operational Executor Agent’s Executor Accord through a vote if necessary.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7 - Peg Stability Module Management And Ownership [Core]  <!-- UUID: 63922aed-a1e4-43f2-a4a7-437b80ea6711 -->

The subdocuments herein set out agreed terms with respect to the Peg Stability Module (PSM).

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.1 - Current and Future Control [Core]  <!-- UUID: b66f99ce-af91-4b32-a37a-fb26d16b57c4 -->

The subdocuments herein set out details about the current control and oversight of the PSM, including the transition to ownership by Grove.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.1.1 - Current Control (Until 2026) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 815fc554-c019-49b1-8b97-9eb62082cb5b -->

The Peg Stability Module (PSM) remains directly managed and controlled by Sky until the full deployment and operationalization of the Actively Stabilizing Collateral (ASC) system. Sky retains responsibility for setting debt ceilings, determining liquidity levels, and overseeing asset management activities within the PSM during this period.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.1.2 - Transition to Grove (2025) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 08896aa0-140a-4289-9027-1772a0109a35 -->

Beginning in 2025, Grove shall assume operational and accounting ownership of the PSM, incorporating the PSM’s assets into its total value locked (TVL). Sky maintains active oversight and retains final control over strategic and operational decision-making within the PSM until full ASC implementation occurs.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.2 - Operational Responsibilities [Core]  <!-- UUID: 704ccd85-e80e-478f-ab73-23d775968ca7 -->

The subdocuments herein set out details about operational responsibilities relating to the PSM.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.2.1 - Base Rate Obligation [Core]  <!-- UUID: ff46baec-15da-4bf7-be18-e145f1809cf6 -->

Grove will be required to pay the Base Rate on all assets within the PSM. The Base Rate is dynamic and will align with the SSR (Sky Savings Rate), expected to fluctuate between the Aave and Ethena rates. See [A.2.8.2.2.2.2.3 - Base Rate](fd39df25-6093-49ae-be12-36df34754612).

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.2.2 - Yield on USDC [Core]  <!-- UUID: 223a695c-addd-443a-bfed-b136eeb2eddc -->

Grove shall earn yield through Coinbase Custody on USDC holdings within the PSM, enabling potential positive carry depending upon the spread between custody yield and the Base Rate.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.2.3 - Economic Rationale [Core]  <!-- UUID: b1831dee-c95f-4872-98e0-2e49f3591bf9 -->

Grove will pay the Base Rate on the PSM for the purpose of meeting ASC requirements, if there are no better alternatives available. Unlike other alternatives, USDC in the PSM will have no capital requirement. If other, better options for ASC are available, Grove should empty the PSM and allocate the assets to those options. It is anticipated that other protocols will also be willing to rent ASC "points", potentially allowing for the management of ASC needs across several Prime Agents for a profit.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.3 - Future Transition and Long-Term Vision [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1a26a561-1f03-4d83-81df-3dedc9688597 -->

The subdocuments herein set out agreed terms with respect to the future transition and long-term vision for the PSM.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.3.1 - Short Term (2025-2026) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 54bd8ca5-d078-4b1e-9f0a-e843fe13e5c0 -->

The PSM will remain a central liquidity hub for stablecoin deployment. Grove will manage the PSM, paying the Base Rate while earning USDC yield, under Sky oversight until full ASC implementation. PSM assets will count toward Grove's TVL, enhancing its economic standing and collateral efficiency.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.3.2 - Long Term (Post-2026) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4478d3b2-f8bc-400f-b6da-3bb43684e94d -->

The PSM's role will diminish as the ASC system becomes the primary liquidity management tool. Grove can wind down the PSM entirely if ASC requirements are fulfilled through other mechanisms (e.g., Uniswap positions, Curve pools). If ASC obligations rise significantly, PSM usage will increase, but as the system matures, its relevance will gradually decline.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.4 - Implications for Grove [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3215686b-a770-484d-9602-6ee9d84c0e44 -->

The subdocuments herein set out implications of the PSM terms with respect to Grove.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.4.1 - Positive Carry And Liquidity Balancing [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9ed13fe5-7b07-4222-93ff-640880a976e2 -->

Grove can generate positive carry if the USDC yield exceeds the Base Rate. If the Base Rate rises significantly, the PSM may become costly, requiring liquidity balancing.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.4.2 - Capital Efficiency [Core]  <!-- UUID: 207d4658-b6f4-4937-853c-b5d23cff3c89 -->

Grove can deploy USDC in high-yield strategies while retaining enough ASC to meet requirements. Aave USDC (aUSDC) and Curve LP positions are likely alternatives to direct PSM usage, albeit potentially with higher JRC requirements.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.7.4.3 - Risk Management [Core]  <!-- UUID: 00aa264d-4fe6-41a1-91ea-014a2a520001 -->

The PSM serves as a capital buffer, enabling Grove to scale liquidity massively without additional credit enhancement. As ASC obligations fluctuate, the PSM will act as a dynamic backstop, ensuring resilience during periods of high demand.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.8 - Token Launch Penalty, Capital Transfer, And Income Generation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2df67c30-1644-4455-a3e4-f3047c4c49ae -->

The Grove Token Generation Event will occur on the first date that SKY Staking users are able to earn GROVE Token Rewards. See [A.4.4.1 - SKY Staking](626bd71c-b413-41b7-a5fe-39fd0d43dbf5).

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.8.1.2 - Token Launch Penalty Settlement [Core]  <!-- UUID: c680762a-a3f9-46bf-b740-9029b8a97e2b -->

The Token Launch Penalty will be paid by each Prime at the time of the last Capital Transfer to a Genesis Agent (the "Token Launch Penalty Settlement Date") as specified in the documents herein.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.8.1.2.1 - Token Launch Penalty Settlement Date  [Core]  <!-- UUID: 66269cb6-0828-4977-b9d4-16840c6bc97d -->

When the Core Council determines the date of the last Capital Transfer to a Genesis Agent, it must submit an Atlas Edit Proposal to record the date in this document.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.8.1.2.2 - Token Launch Penalty Settlement Mechanism  [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4c8a37f9-717d-437c-9f38-d17cbb3b3639 -->

The settlement mechanism for the Token Launch Penalty, including the calculation of the penalty for each Prime and how the calculated balance is paid to Sky, will be included in a future iteration of the Atlas.

The transfer of the Genesis Capital Allocation to each Prime SubProxy (i.e. the Spark SubProxy and Grove SubProxy) shall occur once funding from the Surplus Buffer is approved. This condition ensures that capital deployment is aligned with the successful launch of the Prime's token and the commencement of its independent operations.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.8.2.1 - Transfer Of Genesis Capital Allocation To Spark SubProxy [Core]  <!-- UUID: e3ec99ec-54c9-4fe7-8104-aee20c57ec57 -->

The transfer of 20.6 million USDS from the Surplus Buffer to the Spark SubProxy for the Genesis Capital Allocation must be included in the June 26, 2025 Executive Vote. This action is authorized to proceed directly to an Executive Vote without a prior Governance Poll.

This amount reflects that 4.4 million USDS of pre-TGE expenses were paid by Sky as specified in [A.2.8.2.2.2.8.4 - Treatment of Expenses Paid By Sky Pre-TGE](f3672ca1-b305-4e16-86f0-3dc3267073bb). This includes 2 million USDS transferred from the Sky Ecosystem Liquidity Bootstrapping Budget to Spark to provide liquidity to market makers and 2.4 million USDS transferred from the Ecosystem Liquidity Bootstrapping Budget to Spark to provide liquidity to exchanges. See [A.2.8.2.2.2.8.4.1 - Transfer From Liquidity Bootstrapping Budget To Spark For Market Makers](66abd123-f5cd-4d1a-bf75-2e5f468eae16) and [A.2.8.2.2.2.8.4.2 - Transfer From Liquidity Bootstrapping Budget To Spark For Exchanges](1d7924cd-8105-458f-a959-92f302b971d4).

No penalties were applied under [A.2.8.2.2.2.8.1 - Token Launch Penalty](5a62cc3f-4337-4770-a4d1-8a9b3d158b3f).

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.8.3 - Cessation Of MKR and SKY Token Flow [Core]  <!-- UUID: 91c1a218-ea12-4b75-ad71-efc4d1060e58 -->

Upon the commencement of Income Generation (as defined in [A.2.8.2.2.2.8.6 - Income Definition](fa48f7be-3c7d-4390-8b39-4fdfe9aa06ae)) by a Prime, any existing or previously agreed-upon allocation or distribution of MKR or SKY tokens from Sky to that Prime shall immediately cease. The intent is for the Primes to transition to financial self-sufficiency upon the initiation of their respective income-generating activities. Furthermore, any token vesting to the Prime Foundation will be reduced by 50% until the TGE occurs.  Prior to the TGE, Primes agree to share with Sky the Prime Agent Token vesting schedules and lock-ups for their teams to ensure they align with the principles of long-term commitment to the Prime.

###### A.2.8.2.2.2.8.4 - Treatment of Expenses Paid By Sky Pre-TGE [Core]  <!-- UUID: f3672ca1-b305-4e16-86f0-3dc3267073bb -->

Any operational or other expenses incurred by a Prime and paid directly by Sky after July 1, 2025 shall be treated as an advance against the Prime’s Genesis Capital Allocation. The total amount of such expenses shall be documented and shall be deducted from the Prime’s allocated capital funds at the time of the Capital Transfer (as outlined in [A.2.8.2.2.2.8.2 - Transfer Of Capital Funds](760c4258-50f7-4334-af21-888759194e64)).

##### A.3.1.2.5.3 - Use Of Funds [Core]  <!-- UUID: b914352c-f270-46e8-991a-468a4b01dc49 -->

Funds borrowed by Agents from Sky at the Agent Credit Line Borrow Rate must be deposited into the Agent’s Allocation Vault and used to invest in Allocation System Instances. See [A.2.2.9.1 - Allocation System Primitive](9db14ab7-bb4b-4751-8084-843bd4359f2a). These funds may not be transferred to the Agent’s SubProxy account or otherwise outside of the Agent’s designated accounts for its Allocation System Primitive.

##### A.3.1.2.5.4 - Accrued Interest [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9835ebab-59cc-4a2b-b030-3b07b4e9203d -->

Interest accrues on borrowed funds and is reflected in the Allocation Vault balance. Prime Agents must regularly transfer interest payments to the Allocation Vault to pay down accrued interest, ensuring the Allocation Vault balance returns to the principal amount only. Any accrued but unpaid interest reduces the Prime Agent's available Total Risk Capital. See [A.3.2.1.2.1 - Total Risk Capital Definition](6f6b25d6-f73c-4733-ba37-12a0a411433c).

##### A.3.1.2.5.5 - Prime Agent Credit Rating System [Core]  <!-- UUID: 926fb13d-efdd-4a83-a3dc-db1448a106f5 -->

After the development of a Prime Agent Credit Rating System, the Agent Credit Line Borrow Rate will vary based on the Credit Rating of each Prime Agent. The Credit Rating for a Prime Agent will take into account factors including the Encumbrance Ratio and the Prime Spell Security Incident Registry.

### A.3.1.0.3.1 - Methodologies - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 2f658a82-a8d2-4bd1-be5c-906e4733400d -->

The element "stabilize" refers to the objective of maintaining USDS’s value within a narrow range, preventing significant fluctuations that could lead to volatility. USDS should be worth $1 USD to fulfill its promise of being a Stablecoin.

## A.3.2 - Risk Capital [Article]  <!-- UUID: 55999acf-75fe-4adf-8584-9746ef50d3e4 -->

Prime Agents who invest capital from Sky’s Collateral Portfolio using the Allocation System Primitive must hold Risk Capital to protect Sky from potential losses on these investments. This Article sets forth the framework governing Risk Capital.

### A.3.2.1 - Conceptual Framework [Section]  <!-- UUID: ee3a912d-c340-41ee-b33e-45e72f215d49 -->

This Section defines the conceptual framework for Risk Capital.

#### A.3.2.1.1 - Required Risk Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: b6597fb4-d347-44f4-8780-b9a4116c1a36 -->

The documents herein define the conceptual framework for determining the Aggregate Required Risk Capital (RRC) that Prime Agents are required to hold to protect Sky from risks on their investments.

##### A.3.2.1.1.1 - Capital Requirement Ratio [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3828778e-0197-4ce9-a836-6770d04f2ea9 -->

The Capital Requirement Ratio (CRR) with respect to one or more Instances is the Required Risk Capital with respect to such Instances divided by the amount of capital from Sky’s Collateral Portfolio invested in such Instances.

Risk Capital requirements in the Risk Framework may be specified either as an amount of RRC or as a CRR. If a CRR is specified, then the RRC is equal to the amount of capital from Sky’s Collateral Portfolio invested in the relevant Instances times the CRR.

For example, if a certain Instance has a CRR of 5% and 100,000,000 USDS is invested in the Instance, then the RRC is 5,000,000 USDS.

CRR may be specified in aggregate (Aggregate CRR), for a particular Instance (Instance CRR), or for a particular type of risk with respect to an Instance (Instance Financial CRR, Instance Smart Contract CRR, or Instance Administrative CRR).

##### A.3.2.1.1.2 - Aggregate RRC [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6aed5cc1-9671-4b73-88a9-fdd86ac93ece -->

The Aggregate RRC that a Prime Agent must maintain is equal to the sum of the Instance Total RRC for each Active Instance of the Allocation System Primitive that the Prime Agent has deployed.

##### A.3.2.1.1.3 - Instance Total RRC [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5fe6b54c-cc68-4f8a-8d1e-5044af941afe -->

The Instance Total RRC for an Instance is equal to the sum of the Instance Financial RRC, Instance Smart Contract Risk RRC, and Instance Administrative Risk RRC for that Instance. See [A.3.2.1.1.4 - Instance Financial RRC](ba1d5c0e-399f-47a6-b5d4-b3f5477d5787), [A.3.2.1.1.5 - Instance Smart Contract RRC](4b4ea578-28b4-481c-9abd-d34c5a4f383c), and [A.3.2.1.1.6 - Instance Administrative RRC](c2b60f0d-6555-463c-9ad3-2a9746be77c5).

###### A.3.2.1.1.3.1 - Incorporation Of Additional Types Of RRC [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4ce93e4b-e842-475b-bf85-d814e7e9d19c -->

If Instance Financial RRC, Instance Smart Contract Risk RRC, or Instance Administrative Risk RRC for an Instance cannot be calculated then the Instance Total RRC is 100%.

##### A.3.2.1.1.4 - Instance Financial RRC [Core]  <!-- UUID: ba1d5c0e-399f-47a6-b5d4-b3f5477d5787 -->

The documents herein define the conceptual framework for determining the Instance Financial RRC required to protect Sky from financial risk arising from an Instance of the Allocation System Primitive.

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.1 - Introduction [Core]  <!-- UUID: 622580fb-1153-4ef7-8196-4e643f2178b7 -->

The conceptual framework for financial risk is designed to ensure that Prime Agents hold sufficient capital to cover potential losses on their investments in case of an extreme market event. The Financial Risk Framework is based on the Basel Accords developed by the Committee on Bank Supervision, including Basel II, Basel III, and Basel IV. These frameworks are then adapted to reflect the differences between traditional finance and decentralized finance.

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.2 - Financial Risk Categories [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3d1f35bf-4342-45cd-b151-090b241c7ba1 -->

Financial risk can be divided into three categories, as specified in the documents herein. These categories of risk are interrelated, so Instance Financial RRC is not directly associated with these risk categories. Instead, risk models are developed for different asset classes, as specified in [A.3.2.1.1.4.3 - Financial Risk Models](2af9fa64-ab25-4017-920c-f1c07dff4c06). The development of each of these risk models is informed by considerations regarding how each of the financial risk categories impacts the specific asset.

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.2.1 - Credit Risk [Core]  <!-- UUID: ca07880e-7bc4-4f18-a59a-2b5a8cd4374e -->

Credit risk is the risk that a loan or other debt instrument will not be repaid according to agreed terms.

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.2.2 - Market Risk [Core]  <!-- UUID: e0dc140f-8172-497d-8576-ce24a7464e89 -->

Market risk is the risk that a financial asset will decline in value due to market conditions or changes in investor perceptions of the asset.

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.2.3 - Liquidity Risk [Core]  <!-- UUID: 547571b1-83ae-4977-8f39-b136e6d52b9c -->

Liquidity risk is the risk that an asset cannot be sold quickly enough, or in sufficient quantity, at its fair market value without causing a significant price impact.

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.3 - Financial Risk Models [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2af9fa64-ab25-4017-920c-f1c07dff4c06 -->

The conceptual framework for financial risk is implemented through asset class specific risk models. The documents herein define the asset classes that risk models exist or are being developed for, including the high level approach and examples of relevant assets.

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.3.1 - Fully Implemented Risk Models [Core]  <!-- UUID: 419a1d00-fbae-4d26-bd47-8f57677d8001 -->

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.3.1.1 - Lending Markets [Core]  <!-- UUID: b2c5ee5d-81f6-4066-94b5-e9d1b781cbc9 -->

The model for lending markets focuses on Credit Risk by incorporating asset volatility and liquidity factors. This model can be applied to lending markets such as SparkLend, Aave, Morpho, Fluid, and Maple. The implementation of the model for lending markets is specified in [A.3.2.2.1.1.1.1 - Lending Markets](d4e9c9e0-eeab-4399-99a0-5f72ff0d0e43).

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.3.1.2 - Real World Assets [Core]  <!-- UUID: 72076b08-d4f4-4cbf-af6d-379363cade39 -->

The model for Real World Assets is based on the direct application of existing frameworks to evaluate the risk of tokenized Real World Assets. The implementation of the model for Real World Assets is specified in [A.3.2.2.1.1.1.5 - Real World Assets](79c20bfd-f724-482e-8aae-52c962b8268a).

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.3.2 - Pending Risk Models [Core]  <!-- UUID: 81ca88bf-3f6a-4d10-a3e2-d47cf6636d7d -->

The documents herein define pending asset-class-specific risk models.

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.3.2.1 - Perpetual Positions [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8e518098-6a0b-4a31-b726-0739000a51ed -->

The model for perpetual positions uses a modified Credit Risk model to evaluate the risk of tokenized delta-neutral positions, such as Ethena and Resolv. The implementation of the model for perpetual positions is specified in [A.3.2.2.1.1.1.2 - Perpetual Positions](69fac7fa-6168-4b74-99cc-28b557826556).

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.3.2.2 - Direct Exposures [Core]  <!-- UUID: 38580dc9-dc5b-4842-88a2-7ab6eb3fcb14 -->

The model for direct exposures combines Market Risk and Liquidity Risk to evaluate the risk of direct asset holdings of volatile cryptoassets, such as ETH, stETH, and WBTC. The implementation of the model for direct exposures is specified in [A.3.2.2.1.1.1.3 - Direct Exposures](69d0776b-786c-408b-b76a-860ea60b6b9a).

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.3.2.3 - Bond-Like Instruments [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1d4cd705-2892-4b59-82e8-609c4649652d -->

The model for bond-like instruments uses a modified Credit Risk model to evaluate the risk of cryptoassets with duration risk, such as Pendle’s PT-tokens. The implementation of the model for bond-like instruments is specified in [A.3.2.2.1.1.1.4 - Bond-Like Instruments](da1a154c-6db8-4012-91a7-31ea4e73e95d).

###### A.3.2.1.1.4.3.2.4 - Cash Stablecoins [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0658e6cd-d785-498a-94c4-71cfbc319c24 -->

The model for Cash Stablecoins is based on identifying stablecoins, such as USDC and USDT, that do not present significant Market Risk, Credit Risk, or Liquidity Risk. The implementation of the model for Cash Stablecoins is specified in [A.3.2.2.1.1.1.6 - Cash Stablecoins](3c0a9e8b-4a0b-4059-87a4-155deaee0486).

##### A.3.2.1.1.5 - Instance Smart Contract RRC [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4b4ea578-28b4-481c-9abd-d34c5a4f383c -->

The documents herein define the conceptual framework for determining the Instance Smart Contract RRC required to protect Sky from smart contract risk arising from an Instance of the Allocation System Primitive.

###### A.3.2.1.1.5.1 - Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8536fbd1-674d-4982-bd50-0bacf0986ce2 -->

Smart Contract Risk refers to the risk that an investment through the Allocation System will experience a loss of funds due to a bug or technical exploit. This risk may arise from the protocol invested in or other aspects of the investment such as bridging requirements.

###### A.3.2.1.1.5.2 - Risk Rating [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3cdbe77b-5df8-4ebb-9604-65db818abe69 -->

The determination of Smart Contract Risk should initially be based on an evaluation of the risk that the investment could experience losses due to a bug or technical exploit. This determination should take into account factors such as (1) the technical complexity of the code base (e.g. cyclomatic complexity, decision points, number of external calls, lines of code), (2) the number, quality, and recency of audits, and (3) the "Lindiness" of the relevant smart contracts.

###### A.3.2.1.1.5.3 - Required Risk Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: eee90ace-5ee9-4efe-be26-6d3597d8b4a1 -->

The risk of a technical exploit in one protocol is unlikely to be correlated with the risk of a technical exploit in an unrelated protocol. Therefore, the risks from small exposures to even relatively risky protocols are likely to be diversified away. In contrast, very large exposures to even relatively safe protocols can create a risk to a Prime Agent and potentially to Sky itself if there is a technical exploit, especially if multiple Prime Agents have the same exposure. To account for this, the calculation of Instance Smart Contract RRC should take into account the risk rating, the level of exposure of the Prime, and the level of exposure of the Sky Ecosystem.

###### A.3.2.1.1.5.4 - Implementation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3df9da84-f435-4d8d-a432-daa92d12a12c -->

The implementation of the calculation of Instance Smart Contract RRC is specified in [A.3.2.2.1.2 - Instance Smart Contract RRC Implementation](e6cfa64f-68c0-4dac-8cec-a5f9bfcb9080).

##### A.3.2.1.1.6 - Instance Administrative RRC [Core]  <!-- UUID: c2b60f0d-6555-463c-9ad3-2a9746be77c5 -->

The documents herein define the conceptual framework for determining the Instance Administrative RRC required to protect Sky from administrative risk arising from an Instance of the Allocation System Primitive.

###### A.3.2.1.1.6.1 - Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0482b0c5-d78b-4e4a-b6c6-c858368d0b2c -->

Administrative Risk refers to the risk that an investment through the Allocation System will experience a loss of funds due to abuse of privileged access to a protocol. This risk may arise from a multisig or another actor that has the ability to modify the protocol or access funds without going through a governance process.

###### A.3.2.1.1.6.2 - Risk Rating [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3fe89645-48a9-430d-9ff1-925c361bb56f -->

The determination of Administrative Risk should initially be based on an evaluation of the risk that an investment could experience losses due to an abuse of privileged access. This determination should take into account factors such as (1) the level of privileged access that exists, (2) the security delay that such access is subject to, and (3) the "Lindiness" of the system.

###### A.3.2.1.1.6.3 - Required Risk Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: bcb97e92-b578-4195-9ea5-a9e6bf2e201b -->

The risk of an abuse of privileged access in one protocol is unlikely to be correlated with the risk of an abuse of privileged access in an unrelated protocol. Therefore, the risks from small exposures to even relatively risky protocols are likely to be diversified away. In contrast, very large exposures to even relatively safe protocols can create a risk to a Prime Agent and potentially to Sky itself if there is an abuse of privileged access, especially if multiple Prime Agents have the same exposure. To account for this, the calculation of Instance Administrative RRC should take into account the risk rating, the level of exposure of the Prime, and the level of exposure of the Sky Ecosystem.

###### A.3.2.1.1.6.4 - Implementation [Core]  <!-- UUID: ee71508b-9c89-4765-83a5-6e50832549bb -->

The implementation of the calculation of Instance Administrative RRC is specified in [A.3.2.2.1.3 - Instance Administrative RRC Calculation](277d6712-25ff-4566-a42b-38d7e860ae76).

#### A.3.2.1.2 - Total Risk Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: be7589f5-32c0-42d2-8d10-38bceb1de28b -->

The documents herein define the conceptual framework for types of capital that contribute to a Prime Agent’s Total Risk Capital (TRC). Prime Agents must maintain at all times a level of TRC that exceeds their Aggregate RRC or be subject to penalties.

##### A.3.2.1.2.1 - Total Risk Capital Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6f6b25d6-f73c-4733-ba37-12a0a411433c -->

Total Risk Capital is capital that is currently eligible, available, and verifiably under the Prime’s control. For capital to be included in a Prime Agent's TRC, it must be currently deployable towards covering its Required Risk Capital obligations. Consequently, in-flight capital (e.g., assets being bridged) does not contribute towards a Prime’s TRC. Similarly, commitments for future capital, such as Ecosystem Accords for renting Prime-External Junior Risk Capital (SEJRC) or Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital (TEJRC) that have been agreed upon by counterparties but are not yet formally codified within the Atlas, cannot contribute towards a Prime’s TRC until such formalization is complete.

##### A.3.2.1.2.2 - Types Of Risk Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: 24db6047-c829-4d31-ac0e-f81f908186ad -->

TRC comprises two categories based on loss absorption seniority: Junior Risk Capital (JRC) and Senior Risk Capital (SRC), further divided by source.

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.1 - Junior Risk Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: 92e51a94-ef70-4a86-9946-36077ebad1e9 -->

Junior Risk Capital (JRC) is the first capital to absorb losses on investments under the Allocation System. Junior Risk Capital must experience 100% losses before any losses are absorbed by Senior Risk Capital.

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.1.1 - Junior Risk Capital Types [Core]  <!-- UUID: 57b0b226-ae2c-4d47-871d-57e6d3bb1a9f -->

The documents herein define the types of Junior Risk Capital.

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1 - Internal Junior Risk Capital (IJRC) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8728abee-0dc5-449b-b4c2-78698da16f10 -->

Internal Junior Risk Capital is capital owned by the Prime Agent itself. It serves as the foundation for the Prime’s risk capacity: the amount of IJRC directly dictates the maximum External JRC the Prime can source (governed by the External Per Internal ratio) and provides the primary capacity for enabling Senior Risk Capital (via the Senior Per Junior ratio), while also bearing the initial impact of any losses (the Tip JRC mechanism). IJRC must be eligible assets held in the Prime Agent’s designated treasury account (e.g., SubProxy), controlled by the Prime’s root governance.

See [A.3.2.1.2.3.1.1 - External Per Internal Ratio](ff374833-920c-40f6-ae6c-a71d33d99b82), [A.3.2.1.2.3.1.2 - Senior Per Junior Ratio](fbc9a273-d217-4d52-8b3e-b496580f27a2), and [A.3.2.1.2.2.1.2 - JRC Loss Allocation Rules](c201122a-75d2-44fa-b221-4e7c09bf42f2).

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1 - Types Of Eligible Assets For IJRC [Core]  <!-- UUID: a2df2b73-c1c5-40d6-b87e-43ba24f54870 -->

The documents herein define the types of assets that qualify as Internal Junior Risk Capital.

These types will be specified in a future iteration of the Risk Framework.

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.2 - Prime-External Junior Risk Capital (SEJRC) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 00f61aa6-7bb4-4c7f-9492-2e2b2b4e78b2 -->

SEJRC is JRC rented from another Prime Agent via the [A.2.2.9.2 - Junior Risk Capital Rental Primitive](d8086dc0-7e77-4c6b-98c7-5fc41337a1ce). The capital remains in the lender's treasury but counts towards the borrower's JRC amount. SEJRC is represented by a registered Ecosystem Accord signifying that a specified amount of the lending Agent's JRC (held within the lender's treasury) is designated to count towards the borrowing Agent's JRC requirement for the duration and terms specified in the Accord.

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.1.1.3 - Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital (TEJRC) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6dd3c9c2-414b-4f06-bbc7-944f67e1cd89 -->

Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital is capital provided by external capital providers depositing sUSDS into the Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital smart contract, from which Primes can encumber funds. The details of this contract will be specified in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.1.2 - JRC Loss Allocation Rules [Core]  <!-- UUID: c201122a-75d2-44fa-b221-4e7c09bf42f2 -->

This document defines the conceptual framework for distributing losses within the JRC layer.

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.1.2.1 - Initial Loss Absorption By “Tip JRC” [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6c33bcf5-c29d-48ca-9ee5-e37dcdeb0630 -->

The Tip JRC mechanism dictates that losses from a distinct risk event are first absorbed entirely by the Prime Agent's Internal Junior Risk Capital (IJRC), up to a specific threshold amount. This threshold amount is calculated as a percentage of Total JRC and is specified in [A.3.2.2.2.1 - JRC Loss Allocation Parameters](b718459e-57e0-414f-9c99-fbc82685cc0f).

Only losses exceeding this threshold amount trigger absorption by other Junior Risk Capital components - specifically, the remaining IJRC and External Junior Risk Capital. This initial absorption solely by IJRC ensures that Prime Agents are highly incentivized to prevent losses and avoids the need to resolve disputes regarding the allocation of small losses to EJRC providers.

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.1.2.2 - Post-Tip JRC Loss Allocation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 64cc7061-1bdf-4f1d-8300-fafb3743578b -->

If a loss event exceeds the Tip JRC amount, the remaining loss is allocated pro-rata across the rest of the JRC capital. This includes the remaining Internal Junior Risk Capital (Total IJRC minus the Tip amount) and all External Junior Risk Capital (Prime External Junior Risk Capital plus Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital).

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.1.2.3 - Per-Event Basis [Core]  <!-- UUID: ca685840-ab9a-4fa8-8f08-794536b94490 -->

The JRC loss allocation rules are applied independently based on the total losses attributed to each distinct risk event. The concept of "per-event basis" is crucial; the classification of a distinct risk event (classifying losses as one large event versus multiple smaller ones) can dictate whether the Tip JRC threshold is breached.

Breaching the threshold activates the pro-rata sharing mechanism for any losses exceeding the Tip JRC amount, distributing such excess losses between both the remaining Internal JRC (IJRC) and all External JRC (EJRC). Conversely, if the threshold is not breached for an event, the loss is contained entirely within the Tip layer and absorbed solely by IJRC.

The operational process for the determination of distinct risk events will be defined in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.2 - Senior Risk Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6bba2076-5d5b-43fd-82c6-df6a35f67355 -->

Senior Risk Capital (SRC) is protected from losses relative to Junior Risk Capital. Senior Risk Capital only begins to absorb losses after Junior Risk Capital has experienced 100% losses and absorbs 100% of losses thereafter.

Senior Risk Capital can be originated from Sky Core on a monthly basis as part of the Monthly Settlement Cycle; Prime Agents can also rent Senior Risk Capital from each other.

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.2.1 - Senior Risk Capital Types [Core]  <!-- UUID: d2e9a92e-dd5d-4a26-8fc6-c5b47a2c06c2 -->

The documents herein define the types of Senior Risk Capital.

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.2.1.1 - Internal Senior Risk Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: 09c20045-4b53-4370-98b8-a1199ccf7007 -->

Internal Senior Risk Capital (ISRC) is capital provided from Sky Core’s Surplus Buffer. The composition of Internal Senior Risk Capital will be specified in more detail in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.3.2.1.2.2.2.1.2 - External Senior Risk Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2adf8738-09b2-43e2-884c-c4ce6ff601ba -->

External Senior Risk Capital (ESRC) is capital provided from the srUSDS smart contract, which allow users to provide USDS to Sky Core to serve as senior risk capital in exchange for higher returns. The mechanics of this are specified in [A.3.2.2.4.2 - External Senior Risk Capital And srUSDS System](9fac0f6b-cb2d-4dc2-97d5-72c705303675).

##### A.3.2.1.2.3 - Total Risk Capital Sourcing Ratios [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9e99b084-f15a-4f60-b831-d6c0bd9aec04 -->

The documents herein define the required relationship and constraints between the different types of Total Risk Capital. These ensure that the Prime Agent maintains the appropriate level of Internal Junior Risk Capital relative to its External and Senior capital exposures, ensuring sufficient "skin in the game" with respect to its investments.

###### A.3.2.1.2.3.1 - Definition Of Ratios [Core]  <!-- UUID: e600afc0-6f8e-42a7-9413-9ef2f5cf0ebb -->

The documents herein define the Total Risk Capital sourcing ratios.

###### A.3.2.1.2.3.1.1 - External Per Internal Ratio [Core]  <!-- UUID: ff374833-920c-40f6-ae6c-a71d33d99b82 -->

The External Per Internal (EPI) ratio determines the maximum amount of External Junior Risk Capital (SEJRC and TEJRC combined) that a Prime Agent can source directly based on its held Internal Junior Risk Capital (IJRC). This acts as the primary constraint ensuring a baseline level of the Prime’s own capital backs its external JRC sourcing. The required External Per Internal ratio is specified in [A.3.2.2.2.2.1 - External Per Internal (EPI) Ratio Value](3ed32706-c072-42b5-b1e5-187bddf8dc37).

###### A.3.2.1.2.3.1.2 - Senior Per Junior Ratio [Core]  <!-- UUID: fbc9a273-d217-4d52-8b3e-b496580f27a2 -->

The Senior Per Junior (SPJ) ratio defines the effectiveness of each type of Junior Risk Capital (IJRC, SEJRC, TEJRC) in supporting Senior Risk Capital (SRC). Specifically, it quantifies how many units of SRC (whether Originated or Rented) can be activated or "enabled" per unit of a given JRC type.

A Prime Agent's overall "SPJ capacity" is calculated by summing the potential enablement contributed by each type of JRC it holds (IJRC, SEJRC or TEJRC), where each contribution equals the amount of that JRC type multiplied by its specific SPJ ratio.

Since SRC only absorbs losses after JRC is depleted,  the SPJ enablement mechanism validates that sufficient JRC backing exists, allowing enabled SRC to be counted as part of the Prime Agent's total eligible Risk Capital. Therefore, a Prime Agent might hold a certain amount of OSRC or rented SRC, but only the portion that is successfully "enabled" by its JRC according to the SPJ ratios is accounted by the system as eligible capital contributing towards the Prime’s satisfaction of its Required Risk Capital. The required ratio of Senior Per Junior is specified in [A.3.2.2.2.2.2 - Senior Per Junior (SPJ) Ratio Values](8578e240-3fe8-41c0-8b2c-15ec9a7181ab).

###### A.3.2.1.2.3.1.2.1 - Alternative Use Of SPJ Capacity To Source External Junior Risk Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: 03029174-91b4-4974-af1e-52438556a70b -->

A Prime Agent may optionally choose to deploy all or some portion of its calculated SPJ capacity not to enable Senior Risk Capital, but instead to source additional External Junior Risk Capital. This provides a secondary mechanism to increase the total JRC potentially beyond the amount initially constrained by the EPI ratio applied solely to IJRC.

Crucially, the EJRC tranche acquired through utilizing SPJ capacity is permanently accounted for as having an SPJ ratio of zero (0). It contributes to the JRC buffer but provides no capacity itself for enabling SRC in any subsequent calculations. This contrasts with EJRC sourced normally via the EPI ratio, which retains its standard SPJ capacity.

###### A.3.2.1.2.3.2 - Interaction Between Ratios And SPJ Capacity [Core]  <!-- UUID: e19dc42d-10d4-46d1-81e7-081f2f3e79f9 -->

The sourcing of External Junior Risk Capital and enablement of Senior Risk Capital involves a sequential application of the Risk Capital sourcing ratios in conjunction with the Prime Agent’s deployment of its SPJ capacity.

First, the EPI ratio sets the initial limit for sourcing standard, SPJ-bearing EJRC based solely on the Prime Agent’s IJRC.
Second, the total SPJ capacity is calculated from the Prime Agent’s resulting JRC pool (IJRC + any EPI-sourced EJRC).

Finally, this total calculated SPJ capacity can be allocated by the Prime Agent to enable SRC (standard use), and/or to source additional, non-SPJ-bearing EJRC using the mechanism described under [A.3.2.1.2.3.1.2.1 - Alternative Use Of SPJ Capacity To Source External Junior Risk Capital](03029174-91b4-4974-af1e-52438556a70b). Any specific portion of the total SPJ capacity allocated towards sourcing EJRC cannot simultaneously be allocated towards enabling SRC.

###### A.3.2.2.1.3.1 - Administrative Risk Rating Calculation [Core]  <!-- UUID: a9dfd122-2862-4759-aba7-482f86428ca7 -->

The first step in calculating the Instance Administrative RRC with respect to an Allocation System opportunity is to calculate the Administrative Risk Rating $\text{ARR}$ for the protocol being invested in. The $\text{ARR}$ is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{ARR} = min[\text{CAP}, \text{SR} \times \text{DF} \times \text{LAF}]
$$

Here $min$ is the mathematical minimum function that returns the lesser of the specified parameters.

The parameters of this formula are specified in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.3.2.2.1.3.1.1 - Administrative Risk Rating Cap [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7e359ea6-e846-4977-b3db-87fc1db64c0f -->

###### A.3.2.2.1.3.1.2 - Starting Rating [Core]  <!-- UUID: 368786cb-da80-4d48-a2e8-52d14fb6320c -->

The Starting Rate $\text{SR}$ is an initial risk rating for Administrative Risk before taking into account the Delay Factor and Lindy Adjustment Factor. It is a function of the type of backdoor access that exists to the protocol, as specified in the documents herein.

###### A.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.1 - No Backdoor [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0d40ea83-8eef-4bea-b1ca-5700fb4536bc -->

A protocol with no backdoor access allows no privileged access to the relevant smart contracts by a whitelisted set of users. The Starting Rate for a protocol with no backdoor access is `0`.

###### A.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.2 - Limited Backdoor [Core]  <!-- UUID: ef31a379-c7ea-43c6-9a68-0f6083fcfeaf -->

A protocol with limited backdoor access allows a set of privileged users to materially modify the terms of the smart contracts (e.g. freezing the transfer of funds) but does not allow root backdoor access as specified in [A.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.3 - Root Backdoor](7d203683-a16c-479c-8425-2fed3b4c2375). The Starting Rate for a protocol with limited backdoor access is `50`.

###### A.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.3 - Root Backdoor [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7d203683-a16c-479c-8425-2fed3b4c2375 -->

A protocol with root backdoor access allows a set of privileged users to make arbitrary changes to the terms of the smart contracts, including transferring user funds. The Starting Rate for a protocol with root backdoor access is `100`.

###### A.3.2.2.1.3.1.3 - Delay Factor [Core]  <!-- UUID: 52511026-55f4-4848-95a2-53db048d906c -->

The Delay Adjustment Factor $\text{DF}$ is a factor indicating the extent to which the risk associated with backdoor access is mitigated by a security delay between the time that a change using backdoor access is approved and the time that such a change becomes effective. This delay gives users time to raise issues or withdraw funds in the event of malicious or undesirable use of backdoor access.

The Delay Factor is `1` if there is no security delay and `0` if the security delay is 48 hours or greater. For security delays between 0 hours and 48 hours, the Delay Factor is linearly reduced for each hour of security delay. So a security delay of 24 hours would result in a Delay Factor of `0.5`.

###### A.3.2.2.1.3.1.4 - Lindy Adjustment Factor [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1d676660-675c-40a4-8319-23671c55491b -->

The Lindy Adjustment Factor $\text{LAF}$ is calculated using the same methodology specified in [A.3.2.2.1.2.2.4 - Lindy Adjustment Factor](227eff62-f2aa-4e49-91ad-1321261ed299).

###### A.3.2.2.1.3.3.5 - Fluid [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6bbbfa59-7988-4d34-bd75-05402d8ac6f8 -->

The Administrative Risk Rating for Fluid is `25`.

#### A.3.2.2.2 - Core Risk Capital Parameters [Core]  <!-- UUID: 15276567-bf61-4c27-8aa2-2f27da831a48 -->

The documents herein define the core risk capital parameters.

##### A.3.2.2.2.1 - JRC Loss Allocation Parameters [Core]  <!-- UUID: b718459e-57e0-414f-9c99-fbc82685cc0f -->

This document specifies the JRC loss allocation parameters.

###### A.3.2.2.2.1.1 - Tip Junior Risk Capital Percentage [Core]  <!-- UUID: 73f2410b-3579-4c68-ae36-e4a4713a6e4b -->

The Tip JRC amount is **10%** of the Prime Agent's Total Junior Risk Capital (IJRC + SEJRC + TEJRC).

For example, if a Prime Agent has $20 million of Internal Junior Risk Capital and $20 million of Prime External Junior Risk Capital, the Tip Junior Risk Capital would be $4 million.

##### A.3.2.2.2.2 - Risk Capital Composition Structural Ratios [Core]  <!-- UUID: c8b80b82-abe9-43d0-96bb-bfc82c83feb4 -->

This document specifies the values of the Risk Capital sourcing ratios defined in [A.3.2.1.2.3 - Total Risk Capital Sourcing Ratios](9e99b084-f15a-4f60-b831-d6c0bd9aec04).

###### A.3.2.2.2.2.1 - External Per Internal (EPI) Ratio Value [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3ed32706-c072-42b5-b1e5-187bddf8dc37 -->

The External Per Internal (EPI) ratio is **1.00**. For example, if a Prime Agent has $20 million of Internal Junior Risk Capital, the EPI ratio enables it to source $20 million of External Junior Risk Capital.

This EPI ratio governs the initial mechanism for sourcing EJRC (SEJRC + TEJRC) and is based purely on the Prime’s IJRC; Primes can source EJRC via this initial mechanism up to a maximum amount equal to their IJRC holdings. However, additional EJRC may potentially be acquired via the alternative use of SPJ capacity, as described in [A.3.2.1.2.3.1.2.1 - Alternative Use Of SPJ Capacity To Source External Junior Risk Capital](03029174-91b4-4974-af1e-52438556a70b).

###### A.3.2.2.2.2.2 - Senior Per Junior (SPJ) Ratio Values [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8578e240-3fe8-41c0-8b2c-15ec9a7181ab -->

The SPJ ratio varies by the JRC type used for enablement:

- Internal Junior Risk Capital SPJ: **1.00**,
- EPI-acquired Prime External Junior Risk Capital SPJ: **0.75**,
- EPI-acquired Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital SPJ: **0.50**,
- SPJ-acquired External Junior Risk Capital (SEJRC or TEJRC): **zero (0)**.

For example, if a Prime Agent has $20 million of Internal Junior Risk Capital, $10 million of Prime External Junior Risk Capital, and $10 million of Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital, then it would be able to count or "enable" $32.5 million of Senior Capital towards its required Risk Capital.

#### A.3.2.2.3 - Junior Risk Capital System Implementation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2c7c0297-28d5-4954-be87-ffc24d70cef5 -->

The implementation of the SEJRC rental system is defined as a Sky Primitive, specifically, the Junior Risk Capital Rental Primitive. See [A.2.2.9.2 - Junior Risk Capital Rental Primitive](d8086dc0-7e77-4c6b-98c7-5fc41337a1ce).

##### A.3.2.2.3.2 - Tokenized External JRC System Implementation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 025c8a59-3c2e-4b33-a635-bb84b6ac6496 -->

This document will be further developed in a future iteration of the Atlas.

#### A.3.2.2.4 - Senior Risk Capital System Implementation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6d2be0c6-37fe-42ba-a4a8-a18dd17b0bc1 -->

The documents herein define operational requirements and protocols for the implementation of the Senior Risk Capital system in the Risk Framework.

##### A.3.2.2.4.1 - Sourcing Of Internal Senior Risk Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: 70888f64-f53f-488a-b138-b3b2ab2300b0 -->

ISRC is sourced from the various surplus buffers, which are themselves funded via the Treasury Management Function. See [A.2.3.1.2 - Allocation Steps](7932c8f3-ce44-49ea-adc4-f6391c621c6e).

##### A.3.2.2.4.2 - External Senior Risk Capital And srUSDS System [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9fac0f6b-cb2d-4dc2-97d5-72c705303675 -->

The documents herein define rules and infrastructure pertaining to the sourcing of External Senior Risk Capital (ESRC). ESRC is capital provided by external investors to be invested as Senior Risk Capital of Prime Agents.

###### A.3.2.2.4.2.1 - srUSDS Contract [Core]  <!-- UUID: 30e9de3a-d67f-4b89-a777-a9781aab9b1a -->

srUSDS is the tokenized form of External Senior Risk Capital. Users can deposit USDS into the srUSDS contract to provide External Senior Risk Capital to the SRC system, making it available for origination by Prime Agents. See [A.3.2.2.4.3 - Senior Risk Capital (SRC) Origination Process](b74e61f5-3793-406d-a0e5-f8f0e4d3ac2f). srUSDS holders can potentially earn higher yields in exchange for the risk that the External Senior Risk Capital will suffer losses.

###### A.3.2.2.4.2.2 - Deposit And Redemption Queues [Core]  <!-- UUID: 38a99586-4a13-4ce3-8b2f-cee025e0c390 -->

The srUSDS contract utilizes distinct queues for managing conversions. Users can add USDS to the deposit queue for conversion into srUSDS; or add srUSDS to the redemption queue for conversion back into USDS at any point during the month.

Assets placed in either queue can be withdrawn by the user at any time before the Monthly Settlement Cycle begins.

At the Monthly Settlement Cycle, all assets remaining in the queues are processed: queued USDS is converted into srUSDS, and queued srUSDS is converted into USDS based on the prevailing Conversion Rate. See [A.3.2.2.4.2.3 - Conversion Rate](2220b1b5-f2f6-4325-9bb5-43cca84e184c).

###### A.3.2.2.4.2.3 - Conversion Rate [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2220b1b5-f2f6-4325-9bb5-43cca84e184c -->

The conversion rate represents the amount of USDS redeemable per unit of srUSDS. This rate increases or decreases over time, reflecting the net return earned by the ESRC pool. The rate is updated at the conclusion of each Monthly Settlement Cycle based on the performance of the ESRC pool during the preceding month, according to the following standard compounding formula:

`New srUSDS Conversion Rate = Previous Conversion Rate * (1 + Monthly srUSDS Yield)`

The parameters of this formula are defined in the documents herein.

###### A.3.2.2.4.2.3.1 - Previous Conversion Rate [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7074ce0f-5a30-40cf-804f-7621233ac9db -->

`Previous Conversion Rate` is the conversion rate (USDS per srUSDS) that was in effect at the beginning of the concluded monthly cycle. The initial conversion rate between srUSDS and USDS is 1:1.

###### A.3.2.2.4.2.3.2 - Monthly srUSDS Yield [Core]  <!-- UUID: cb9bb5b1-50a7-49d8-8ff6-27269061f87e -->

`Monthly srUSDS Yield` represents the net percentage return earned solely by the ESRC pool during the concluded monthly cycle, distributable to srUSDS holders via the conversion rate adjustment. It directly reflects the risk-adjusted performance of the capital deployed and is calculated as:

`[(Total Interest Paid by Stars on ESRC Portion - Losses Allocated to ESRC) / ESRC Principal at start of month - Sky Spread] * (1 - ESRC Earnings Fee)`

The Sky Spread and ESRC Earnings Fee are defined in [A.3.2.2.4.2.3.3.1 - Sky Spread](c160f99c-c3d8-41e9-a3d1-cde514b7a2da) and [A.3.2.2.4.2.3.3.2 - ESRC Earnings Fee](559f6fb6-daf6-41b2-9882-53a91aaf132f), respectively.

###### A.3.2.2.4.2.3.3 - Sources Of Revenue To Sky [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2e3dcac8-d641-49b7-94e9-6947f0a413ca -->

Sky earns revenue from facilitating ESRC from two sources. These sources are included in the formula and defined in the subdocuments below.

###### A.3.2.2.4.2.3.3.1 - Sky Spread [Core]  <!-- UUID: c160f99c-c3d8-41e9-a3d1-cde514b7a2da -->

Sky takes a spread equal to the Sky Spread on all ESRC balances. The Sky Spread is the difference between (1) the rate at which Prime Agents borrow from Sky and (2) the Sky Savings Rate plus the Distribution Reward Fee.

###### A.3.2.2.4.2.3.3.2 - ESRC Earnings Fee [Core]  <!-- UUID: 559f6fb6-daf6-41b2-9882-53a91aaf132f -->

Sky takes a 5% fee on the net interest earnings generated from the ESRC portion of originated SRC before these earnings are distributed to srUSDS holders via the conversion rate adjustment.

###### A.3.2.2.4.2.4 - srUSDS Distribution Reward [Core]  <!-- UUID: 626f0f67-1df9-41e8-a4a6-230aa1ccc824 -->

Prime Agents and third-party partners that drive srUSDS usage are entitled to a srUSDS Distribution Reward similar to the Distribution Reward paid on USDS balances. The srUSDS Distribution Reward Fee is the same as the Distribution Reward Fee on USDS. See [A.2.2.8.1 - Distribution Reward Primitive](e632c38f-3e4e-4c7e-acfd-b6ec45a422e6).

##### A.3.2.2.4.3 - Senior Risk Capital (SRC) Origination Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: b74e61f5-3793-406d-a0e5-f8f0e4d3ac2f -->

This document defines the operational details of the recurring monthly process allowing Prime Agents to originate Senior Risk Capital (Originated Senior Risk Capital or OSRC) from the Total Senior Risk Capital (TSRC) pool. The process involves determining the available TSRC supply, a bidding phase, an allocation auction, and settlement aligned with the Monthly Settlement Cycle.

###### A.3.2.2.4.3.1 - Process Timing and Schedule [Core]  <!-- UUID: d06b1c1a-7613-4361-a155-f62f68ec30a1 -->

The SRC origination process operates monthly, synchronized with the Monthly Settlement Cycle. The bidding window occurs during the current month for SRC that is usable in the next month; the bidding window closes before settlement processing begins. Additional operational details, including timelines, will be specified in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.3.2.2.4.3.2 - Available Total Senior Risk Capital Pool Determination [Core]  <!-- UUID: 48a3a23c-2e2f-48b8-bcca-6c99d1c2b6ca -->

Total Senior Risk Capital (TSRC) is the amount of Senior Risk Capital that is available each Monthly Settlement Cycle for Primes to originate and thus turn into Originated Senior Risk Capital (OSRC) through the monthly origination process. TSRC is the sum of designated Internal Senior Risk Capital (ISRC) from Sky surplus buffers and available External Senior Risk Capital (ESRC) from the srUSDS contract. Prior to each monthly bidding window, the TSRC is calculated and publicly announced. Additional operational details will be defined in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.3.2.2.4.3.3 - Bidding Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 33ef06d4-6ee3-4302-943d-1b932d8c88b4 -->

Participating Prime Agents submit bids via the Powerhouse interface during the defined bidding window. Each bid must specify: (1) The quantity of SRC the Prime seeks to originate, and (2) The maximum price the Prime is willing to pay (expressed in basis points above the Base Rate) for using the OSRC during the upcoming monthly period. Additional operational details will be specified in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.3.2.2.4.3.4 - Allocation & Clearing Price Determination [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0234bb0c-4686-40bc-94e5-13cd8bcd0db7 -->

Bids are ranked descending by price. TSRC is allocated sequentially to the highest bids until the pool is exhausted or all bids are filled. The price of the lowest successful bid that receives an allocation (even partial) sets the uniform clearing price for the month. All winning bidders pay this clearing price per unit of OSRC allocated, regardless of their original bid price. Additional operational details will be specified in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.3.2.2.4.3.5 - Settlement Of Origination [Core]  <!-- UUID: fff0112a-58dd-4041-97f9-7baf113b4e70 -->

During the Monthly Settlement Cycle following allocation, the cost (Allocated OSRC Quantity * Clearing Price) is deducted from each winning Prime Agent’s operational account. Concurrently, the allocated OSRC amount is credited to the Prime Agent’s Risk Capital account as OSRC for the upcoming monthly period.

###### A.3.2.2.4.3.6 - OSRC Duration and Renewal [Core]  <!-- UUID: b63d43f9-cea7-42ee-bfea-5098e55fa68f -->

OSRC is valid only for the single monthly period following the settlement cycle in which it was originated. Renewal requires successful participation in the next monthly origination process; there is no automatic rollover.

##### A.3.2.2.4.4 - Originated Senior Risk Capital (OSRC) Rental Implementation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 268b4b1f-9a19-42f8-b7c6-d8dc01e32517 -->

The operational process for inter-Prime Agent OSRC risk-capital rentals is defined herein. SEJRC rentals are facilitated through the Junior Risk Capital Rental Primitive. See [A.2.2.9.2 - Junior Risk Capital Rental Primitive](d8086dc0-7e77-4c6b-98c7-5fc41337a1ce).

###### A.3.2.2.4.4.1 - Ecosystem Accord Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0664a5cc-22c9-4d9e-adcf-55ce8c1afc20 -->

Rental of Originated Senior Risk Capital (OSRC) requires a registered Ecosystem Accord specifying: Amount, Duration, and Price/Terms. As the system permits sub-renting (allowing a Prime to rent out OSRC it has previously rented), the Accord must explicitly state if the borrower is granted this permission. In regards to Duration, the Ecosystem Accord must specify the rental period, which cannot extend beyond the end of the current Monthly Settlement Cycle. Primes may agree on any Duration within this limit.

Standardized Ecosystem Accord templates will be provided in a future iteration of the Atlas.

###### A.3.2.2.4.4.2 - SRC Accounting & Enablement [Core]  <!-- UUID: dab711a4-e932-4e2e-bed5-3f459f89cde6 -->

A registered OSRC-rental Ecosystem Accord effectively transfers the claim on the specified amount of the lender’s OSRC to the borrower for the duration of the agreement. The borrowing Prime Agent must possess sufficient Junior Risk Capital (IJRC, SEJRC, TEJRC) and corresponding Senior Per Junior (SPJ) capacity to enable the rented OSRC, such that it counts towards their own Risk Capital requirements. Rented OSRC that is not successfully enabled by the borrower pursuant to the SPJ ratio does not contribute to their Risk Capital calculation.

##### A.3.2.2.4.5 - Short Term Transitionary Measures [Core]  <!-- UUID: d33ac81e-bab1-4969-b46d-e605da2afae3 -->

As an interim measure, prior to the implementation of the Senior Risk Capital System, Sky Core may provide Senior Risk Capital to Prime Agents under Ecosystem Accords between Sky Core and the respective Prime Agents. The terms of such Ecosystem Accords shall be documented under [A.2.8 - Ecosystem Accords](104c3543-ce94-4a2f-9968-57f1ee858085).

#### A.3.2.2.5 - Risk Capital Update Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: d92f0d3b-e6d5-47d4-b6f1-203ef9326ea6 -->

The documents herein define the process for updating Risk Capital requirements.

##### A.3.2.2.5.1 - Schedule For Updating Parameters [Core]  <!-- UUID: f969dee1-774b-4201-97ae-c9fb91960a18 -->

###### A.3.2.2.5.1.1 - Real Time Updates [Core]  <!-- UUID: 23083399-43b0-4bc2-adf8-4e97a9ae494d -->

Inputs into Risk Capital calculations that are based on market or other external variables should be updated in real time or immediately after the underlying data is updated, if the underlying data is only updated periodically.

###### A.3.2.2.5.1.1.1 - Responsibility For Cost Of Real Time Updates [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4c76f9d0-f354-4fba-bf99-2be97b77d234 -->

Prime Agents may develop data feeds that update the Atlas with their data at their expense. Alternatively, the Operational Executor Agent that has an Executor Accord with the Prime Agent may perform this as part of the services it provides to the Prime Agent. In this case, the Operational Executor Agent may charge whatever fees for this service the parties mutually agree on.

###### A.3.2.2.5.1.1.1.1 - Near Term Real Time Updates By Core Council Risk Advisor [Core]  <!-- UUID: 31095e6f-6f05-4d0f-83f6-49ef92e1b6ec -->

In the near term, the Core Council Risk Advisor will provide real time data regarding major lending markets. The Core Council Risk Advisor will be compensated for this work as part of its existing relationship with Sky Core and Spark.

###### A.3.2.2.5.1.2 - Non-Real Time Updates [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7cdc17d9-6199-42bb-8ff9-f7ffce126d3a -->

In the near term, Prime Agents may update calculations that are based on market or other external variables less frequently than real time. If they do so, Operational GovOps must apply a buffer to each variable that is not updated in real time to account for the fact that the variable may change in a way that increases Required Risk Capital between update frequencies.

##### A.3.2.2.5.2 - Data Maintenance And Integrity [Core]  <!-- UUID: d105b84d-c1f6-4460-892c-0971942f8905 -->

The documents herein define processes to maintain and ensure the integrity of data that is used as an input to Risk Capital calculations.

###### A.3.2.2.5.2.1 - Responsibility For Data Updates [Core]  <!-- UUID: ecd07bcd-8a9f-4a3d-b7b0-393f6b5143f7 -->

The Prime Agent may assume responsibility for updating the inputs to the Risk Capital calculations itself, either directly or through one of its agents, or may contract with Operational GovOps to perform that function.

###### A.3.2.2.5.2.2 - Verification Of Data Updates [Core]  <!-- UUID: b80bdd00-c88b-4186-84de-b6c770b915e0 -->

If Operational GovOps does not perform the data updates, it must verify their accuracy.

###### A.3.2.2.5.2.3 - Penalties For Late Data Updates [Core]  <!-- UUID: b6dd98ee-5156-496c-95f3-a6ad0f2eff3b -->

In the near term, Operational GovOps must reduce exposure to any Asset Allocation Conduit if the Prime Agent responsible for that Conduit fails to provide the timely information necessary to calculate the required Risk Capital. In the future, a system of monetary penalties must be developed to compensate Sky for the risk posed by late data submission.

#### A.3.2.2.6 - Process For Adjusting Risk Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: b24ee088-0096-47b0-9e27-4c9e9aeb2d9b -->

The documents herein define how changes to the calculation of Required Risk Capital or Total Risk Capital should be handled.

##### A.3.2.2.6.1 - Updates Due To Changed Market Parameters [Core]  <!-- UUID: 86134cd1-f754-4637-8796-f239ec00e434 -->

The documents herein define the process for handling changes to Required Risk Capital requirements due to changes in market or other external variables.

###### A.3.2.2.6.1.1 - Immediate Update To Required Risk Capital For Changes In Market Or External Variables [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0932bccb-4d3e-4be8-afbf-649227a60435 -->

To the extent that a market or external variable changes in a way that increases the Aggregate Required Risk Capital, the Prime Agent is immediately responsible for supplying additional Total Risk Capital, as necessary, and is subject to penalties for any period in which this Total Risk Capital is not provided. It is the responsibility of the Prime Agent to maintain sufficient capital so that they remain well capitalized in the face of changes to market conditions.

##### A.3.2.2.6.2 - Updates Due To Changed Methodology Or Governance Parameters [Core]  <!-- UUID: 088cba75-a83b-4f85-8923-d98c36ff8714 -->

The documents herein define the process for adjusting the calculation of Required Risk Capital or Total Risk Capital whenever Sky Governance modifies the underlying methodology/parameters governing Risk Capital calculations.

###### A.3.2.2.6.2.1 - Phased Update To Risk Capital For Changes In Methodology Or Governance Parameters [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0f4b2490-bb15-480d-b719-be2bfec69c85 -->

To the extent that a change to the implementation of the Risk Capital framework or a parameter set by Sky Governance changes the Required Risk Capital or Total Risk Capital, the change will phase in over time. The Prime Agent must provide 50% of the additional Total Risk Capital necessary to comply with the change within seven (7) calendar days of the change, and the remaining 50% on a pro rata basis over the following twenty one (21) calendar days.

###### A.3.2.2.6.2.2 - No Penalties For Changes In Methodology Or Governance Parameters In Near Term [Core]  <!-- UUID: e083b732-237d-461b-92a4-fe91ea636e3f -->

In the near term as the Risk Capital implementation continues to be developed, Prime Agents will not be subject to penalties for failing to supply the incremental capital required by changes to the Risk Capital implementation. However, Operational GovOps must reduce the exposure to Allocation Conduits managed by the Prime Agent to bring it back into compliance with capital requirements if the Prime Agent does not work in good faith to provide the additional capital on the timeline specified above.

#### A.3.2.2.7 - Monitoring And Penalty Mechanisms [Core]  <!-- UUID: 50035dc9-4cab-4141-a5d8-a8a4e6870a56 -->

The documents herein define the financial penalties for breaches of Risk Capital requirements.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1 - Encumbrance Ratio [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5435f680-aaaa-461a-bcae-4056bb8964d9 -->

The Encumbrance Ratio for a Prime Agent is the ratio of its Aggregate Required Risk Capital to its Total Risk Capital.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.2 - Severity Of Breaches [Core]  <!-- UUID: cf1bcb59-c72a-4b17-ae4b-e80beb881f57 -->

The financial penalties for breaches of Risk Capital requirements depend on whether the breaches are Low Severity or High Severity. The documents herein define Low Severity and High Severity Breaches. The financial penalties associated with High Severity Breaches and Low Severity Breaches are defined in [A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.4 - Financial Penalties For Low Severity Breaches](f4bef3da-45a1-4575-9e38-78f2a1f95a3d) and [A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.5 - Financial Penalties For High Severity Breaches](970c1ce7-dc45-4c02-bad4-80c9f2e32eab), respectively.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.2.1 - Low Severity Breach Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1981fd65-a9a5-4e5a-a9f8-aa8e85342d7c -->

A Low Severity Breach is one in which the Encumbrance Ratio is greater than or equal to 100% but less than 103%.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.2.2 - High Severity Breach Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 363e2bb5-47e2-4eb8-950d-eafd0f1392c7 -->

A High Severity Breach is one in which the Encumbrance Ratio is greater than 103%.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.3 - Length Of Breaches [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9e689143-99a7-4cae-a6fc-1b1c31da4ff6 -->

The length of a breach refers to the duration measured between its defined start and end points, which depend on the specific aspect of the breach being considered.

If a breach is initially a Low Severity Breach and subsequently becomes a High Severity Breach, then (1) the length of the Low Severity Breach is the duration from when it became a Low Severity Breach until it became a High Severity Breach; and (2) the length of the High Severity Breach is the duration from when it became a High Severity Breach until that high-severity period concludes (e.g., upon final resolution of the breach or a transition to a different severity level).

Likewise, if a breach is initially a High Severity Breach and subsequently becomes a Low Severity Breach, then (1) the length of the High Severity Breach is the duration from when it became a High Severity Breach until it became a Low Severity Breach; and (2) the length of the Low Severity Breach is the duration from when it became a Low Severity Breach until that low-severity period concludes (e.g., upon final resolution of the breach or a transition to a different severity level).

After the first 60 minutes of a Low Severity Breach, the financial penalty is equal to a 1,500% annual percentage yield on the difference between Aggregate Required Risk Capital and Total Risk Capital.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.5 - Financial Penalties For High Severity Breaches [Core]  <!-- UUID: 970c1ce7-dc45-4c02-bad4-80c9f2e32eab -->

The documents herein define the financial penalties for High Severity Breaches.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.5.1 - Financial Penalties For First 15 Minutes [Core]  <!-- UUID: b9bfd816-925e-4403-a4c2-fda647a2c59a -->

For the first 15 minutes of a High Severity Breach, the financial penalty is equal to a 1,500% annual percentage yield on the difference between Aggregate Required Risk Capital and Total Risk Capital.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.5.2 - Financial Penalties For Subsequent 15 Minutes [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7d3dc8ba-d12c-4583-91eb-9a6d29dffd8d -->

For the next 15 minutes of a High Severity Breach after the expiration of the duration specified in [A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.5.1 - Financial Penalties For First 15 Minutes](b9bfd816-925e-4403-a4c2-fda647a2c59a), the financial penalty is equal to a 2,000% annual percentage yield on the difference between Aggregate Required Risk Capital and Total Risk Capital.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.5.3 - Financial Penalties For Subsequent 30 Minutes [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8151947c-c6e7-4551-8cb9-1cfb6e82f6d0 -->

For the next 30 minutes of a High Severity Breach after the expiration of the duration specified in [A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.5.2 - Financial Penalties For Subsequent 15 Minutes](7d3dc8ba-d12c-4583-91eb-9a6d29dffd8d), the financial penalty is equal to a 2,500% annual percentage yield on the difference between Aggregate Required Risk Capital and Total Risk Capital.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.5.4 - Financial Penalties After 60 Minutes [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7f70143b-ddc4-4ad1-b5e1-410fa5ba96e5 -->

After the first 60 minutes of a High Severity Breach, the financial penalty is equal to a 3,000% annual percentage yield on the difference between Aggregate Required Risk Capital and Total Risk Capital.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.6 - Collection Of Penalties [Core]  <!-- UUID: 92bc8eae-deaa-45f2-85f4-1c010d2b5daa -->

Penalties are calculated by the Core Executor Agents as part of the Monthly Settlement Cycle. See [A.2.4 - Sky Core Monthly Settlement Cycle](6f8d5065-d6ff-4add-9a28-eadeffa7ed1a). Once calculated, penalties are transferred from the Prime Agent’s SubProxy Account to Sky by Sky Governance.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.6.1 - Alternative Enforcement Mechanisms [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8067694d-e7a2-46ed-8e35-50f0ecde79c7 -->

In the event that the Prime Agent’s Total Risk Capital is less than its Required Risk Capital at the time of the Monthly Settlement Cycle, or the collection of the penalty would cause the Prime Agent’s Total Risk Capital to fall below its Required Risk Capital, then Sky may exercise the alternative enforcement mechanism described below.

In this instance Sky, at its discretion, may issue additional tokens of the Prime Agent and sell them on the open market until it has collected proceeds equal to the calculated penalty. Any proceeds above the calculated penalty shall be refunded to the Prime Agent SubProxy account.

Alternatively, Sky may convert the penalty into a debt owed by the Prime Agent to Sky Core at terms mutually agreed between Sky Core and the Prime Agent.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.7 - Short-Term Exemption [Core]  <!-- UUID: 829e886b-0d00-488a-bb27-27f12dae9b3b -->

While the Risk Framework undergoes refinement, penalties for any Prime Agent breaches of Required Risk Capital will be calculated by Core GovOps once the infrastructure is in place to do so. This calculation serves the purposes of system monitoring, data gathering, and framework calibration. However, throughout this interim phase, such calculated penalties will not be formally assessed against Prime Agents, and consequently, Prime Agents will not be required to make payment for these penalties. Notwithstanding this temporary exemption from penalty payment, Prime Agents are expected to maintain a Encumbrance Ratio of less than or equal to 90%. See [A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1 - Encumbrance Ratio](5435f680-aaaa-461a-bcae-4056bb8964d9).

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.2 - Additional Token Issuance For Breach Of Capital Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2e1a8489-5849-4030-9ed8-8b9a0b09d483 -->

In the event that financial penalties are not sufficient to address the shortfall because payment of the penalties would exacerbate an existing capital shortfall, Core GovOps may require the Prime Agent to issue additional tokens and sell them to the extent it deems necessary. Operational GovOps will assist Core GovOps in executing any such transaction. Future iterations of the Risk Capital framework will specify a more detailed methodology for required token issuance.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.3 - Restrictions On Investments For Breach Of Capital Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: 291f2548-a473-42f2-b5be-8fad854d8df3 -->

Core GovOps may impose whatever restrictions it deems necessary on the usage of the Allocation System Primitive by the Prime Agent, including limiting the Prime Agent’s exposure to certain Instances (conduits) or prohibiting the Prime Agent from using certain Instances. These restrictions may extend for a period of time that Core GovOps deems fit.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.1.4 - Conservatorship For Breach Of Capital Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5c3dd35a-0c67-44c2-b51b-d40bc865af85 -->

In the event that less extreme measures are not adequate to address the capital shortfall, Core GovOps may seek to put the Prime Agent into conservatorship, in which case Sky Core Facilitators take direct control of the Prime Agent to maximize value for Sky and other Prime Agent stakeholders. Seeking to put a Prime Agent into conservatorship requires immediate escalation to Sky Core Governance and requires an expedited Executive Vote as specified in [A.1.8.1.5.4.1 - Known And Uncontentious Remedies](3f5f79fa-698c-42db-a941-ead5a5d0aa48).

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.2 - Penalty Mechanisms For Operational Executor Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: a56f0e2a-2e3e-45a5-8aac-c7708ff4e20d -->

The documents herein specify the penalty mechanisms for Operational Executor Agents for breaches of Risk Capital requirements.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.2.1 - Financial Penalties For Operational Executor Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: 134f7d3e-fee1-4d9d-aef8-1e5a9b390d21 -->

In the near term there are no penalties for Operational Executor Agents for failure of the Prime Agents they supervise to maintain appropriate levels of capital. In future iterations of the Risk Framework, Operational Executor Agents will be required to put up collateral and act as "insurers" of all activities by the Prime Agents they supervise with regard to the Sky Primitives. At that point Core GovOps will be able to seize this collateral in the event of failure to obtain compensation for breaches of the Risk Capital requirement by the Prime Agent.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.2.2 - Termination Of Executor Accord [Core]  <!-- UUID: 782d49c6-e4db-4d4a-be29-3f005cd654c1 -->

In the event that Core GovOps determines that the Operational Executor Agent is not appropriately supervising the activities of the Prime Agent, Core GovOps may terminate the respective Executor Accord. This requires an immediate escalation to Sky Governance and requires an expedited Executive Vote as specified in [A.1.8.1.5.4.1 - Known And Uncontentious Remedies](3f5f79fa-698c-42db-a941-ead5a5d0aa48). Core GovOps must arrange for another Operational Executor Agent to stand in until the Prime Agent can Invoke the Executor Accord Primitive to enter into a new Executor Accord. The Prime Agent must suspend all operations until a new Executor Accord is voted on and formally integrated into the Agent’s Artifact.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.3 - Escalation To Sky Governance [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7ff23236-91c4-4c5c-b462-d4427b03bfd4 -->

The documents herein specify measures for escalating situations directly to Sky Governance in the event that they cannot be resolved by Core GovOps.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.3.1 - Triggers For Escalation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 36978109-324d-40da-be44-f05809c1544a -->

In the event of a disagreement regarding the penalties for a violation of Risk Capital requirements, either party may escalate the matter to Sky Governance. In addition, the extraordinary remedies of Prime Agent Conservatorship and Executor Accord Termination must always be escalated to a Sky Governance Executive Vote.

###### A.3.2.2.7.2.3.2 - Sky Governance Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1ccb4063-facc-42d6-a71e-21fe29e84519 -->

Once a matter has been escalated to Sky Governance, the Sky Core Facilitators may request any information they deem necessary from Core GovOps, Operational GovOps, and the Prime Agent. Sky Governance then acts through a Governance Poll to determine its resolution of the matter.

## A.3.3 - Asset Liability Management [Article]  <!-- UUID: 6478afd5-7c3f-4bed-a2b7-9f8ee402bb64 -->

The Asset Liability Management framework establishes universal rules for Prime Agents deploying Sky’s Collateral Portfolio to maintain the stability of the USDS peg through highly liquid assets. The Asset Liability Management framework governs collateral allocation across all Agents, via the Allocation System Primitive, and replaces Sky Core’s historical Asset Liability Management mechanisms which will be offboarded entirely or transitioned to Prime Agents.

### A.3.3.1 - Conceptual Framework [Section]  <!-- UUID: dbdb3a38-4438-44a0-af77-9518ada97301 -->

This section defines the conceptual framework for Asset Liability Management.

#### A.3.3.1.1 - Minimum Actively Stabilizing Collateral [Core]  <!-- UUID: de00cd5a-91ab-4c04-8ce1-8aa3b7f3c82b -->

The "Sky Collateral Portfolio" consists of all assets backing USDS, whether deployed by Prime Agents or Sky Core. The Asset Liability Management framework is based on ensuring that a certain percentage of Sky Collateral Portfolio is invested in Actively Stabilizing Collateral, highly liquid market making non-USDS assets that trade for close to 1 USD per USDS. In this way, if there is ever downward pressure on the price of USDS these assets can be used to buy USDS to maintain the peg.

#### A.3.3.1.2 - Minimum Demand Absorption Buffer [Core]  <!-- UUID: 00592be0-8d84-4d3f-8c36-1454b18c27ec -->

The Asset Liability Management also ensures that a certain percentage of the Sky Collateral Portfolio is invested in a Demand Absorption Buffer, highly liquid market making USDS assets that trade for close to 1 USD per USDS. In this way, if there is ever upward pressure on the price of USDS these assets can be used to sell USDS to maintain the peg.

#### A.3.3.1.3 - Application To Prime Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: 810270db-2436-411b-94e4-afbc66492531 -->

Each Prime Agent investing a portion of the Sky Collateral Portfolio must maintain, with respect to its portion of same, the percentage of Actively Stabilizing Collateral and Demand Absorption Buffer specified in [A.3.3.2.2 - Minimum Actively Stabilizing Collateral](475fe222-9e4a-4e9d-9be6-a7a424ce02f8). By ensuring that every Prime Agent maintains these levels, Sky as a whole remains compliant with the required thresholds of Actively Stabilizing Collateral and Demand Absorption Buffer.

##### A.3.3.1.3.1 - Agent Collateral Portfolio [Core]  <!-- UUID: 64e1390f-68a1-43ec-87a8-8ae7b990f7ec -->

An Agent Collateral Portfolio is defined as the total amount of capital that the Prime Agent has deployed from Sky through the Allocation System Primitive, excluding any portion of that capital held in USDS. See [A.2.2.9.1 - Allocation System Primitive](9db14ab7-bb4b-4751-8084-843bd4359f2a).

##### A.3.3.1.3.2 - Actively Stabilizing Collateral [Core]  <!-- UUID: c825a54b-8696-452c-b963-cbe999f61bad -->

Actively Stabilizing Collateral is collateral that actively supports the peg of USDS by market-making and providing buy support at a price close to 1 USD per USDS. The implementation of the Asset Liability Management framework specifies the downside spread that is allowed for collateral to qualify as Actively Stabilizing Collateral. See [A.3.3.2 - Implementation](bf1a1991-1c2b-457c-b1ca-6147049e93c5).

##### A.3.3.1.3.3 - Demand Absorption Buffer [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1a4a64fc-240b-4671-a333-3b35dc1e1e2f -->

The Demand Absorption Buffer is USDS that actively supports the peg of USDS by market-making and providing sell support at a price close to 1 USD per USDS. The implementation of the Asset Liability Management framework specifies the upside spread that is allowed for USDS to qualify toward the Demand Absorption Buffer. See [A.3.3.2 - Implementation](bf1a1991-1c2b-457c-b1ca-6147049e93c5).

#### A.3.3.1.4 - Application To Sky Core [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6e050b66-0bc8-43f1-b32d-2220c9df466b -->

While its legacy ALM infrastructure is being transferred to Prime Agents, Sky Core manages the portion of the Sky Collateral Portfolio not deployed by Prime Agents ("Sky Core Collateral Portfolio"). During this transitional period, Sky Core allocates the Sky Core Collateral Portfolio to Actively Stabilizing Collateral as specified in [A.3.3.2.6 - Sky Core Asset Liability Management Rules](8135523a-dd5f-482d-b522-ec4227746eaf).

#### A.3.3.1.5 - Peg Defense Event [Core]  <!-- UUID: 60d8fa49-f7cc-4b2e-b54a-cdd19b1e0a09 -->

In addition to the requirement for Prime Agents to hold a certain percentage of their Collateral Portfolio in Actively Stabilizing Collateral and the Demand Absorption Buffer, Prime Agents have special responsibilities in extraordinary situations where the stability of the peg is threatened. The definition of these events and the obligations for Prime Agents are specified in the implementation of the framework. See [A.3.3.2 - Implementation](bf1a1991-1c2b-457c-b1ca-6147049e93c5).

#### A.3.3.1.6 - Asset Liability Management Rental [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1a7f0b6c-4ec2-4a5f-bb43-deab9305aab6 -->

To allow the Asset Liability Management obligation of Prime Agents to be satisfied in the most efficient way possible, Prime Agents may enter into Asset Liability Management Rentals between each other, as specified in the Asset Liability Management Rental Primitive. This allows one Prime Agent to hold a greater amount of Actively Stabilizing Collateral to offset another Prime Agent holding a lesser amount. Thus, the overall level of Actively Stabilizing Collateral is unaffected but the Actively Stabilizing Collateral can be held by a Prime Agent that is able to more efficiently hold it.

##### A.3.3.1.6.1 - All Asset Liability Management Obligations Are Rented Together [Core]  <!-- UUID: d2895e10-71cf-416e-8c9c-3f3a9ff80d10 -->

When Asset Liability Management obligations are rented, the associated obligations with regard to Actively Stabilizing Collateral, Demand Absorption Buffer, and Peg Defense Events are all transferred together.

### A.3.3.2 - Implementation [Section]  <!-- UUID: bf1a1991-1c2b-457c-b1ca-6147049e93c5 -->

This Section defines the current implementation of the Asset Liability Management framework.

#### A.3.3.2.1 - Definitions [Core]  <!-- UUID: d6c1d594-eb4a-4a81-b643-977c5c995d7a -->

The documents herein define terms used through the implementation of the Asset Liability Management framework.

##### A.3.3.2.1.1 - Peg Stability Module [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0082c12d-f1a7-46ff-a4aa-5fe42ece1a4d -->

A Peg Stability Module ("PSM") allows users to swap a given collateral type directly for Dai or USDS at a fixed rate, rather than borrowing Dai or USDS. The PSM contract was designed with Stablecoin collateral in mind, allowing users to swap other Stablecoins for Dai or USDS at a fixed rate to aid with keeping Dai or USDS pegged to one (1) USD.

A PSM operates similarly to a regular vault type with a zero Stability Fee and a liquidation ratio of 100% that can only be accessed through a user-facing smart contract containing the relevant swap functions. Unlike regular vaults, users of the PSM do not retain ownership of the asset and borrow Dai or USDS. Instead, PSM users swap the asset directly for Dai or USDS.

##### A.3.3.2.1.2 - Low Risk Real World Assets [Core]  <!-- UUID: 590c645c-8045-4053-9ab1-ea718b62f770 -->

Low Risk RWAs ("LRR") are safe, short-term treasury strategies of less than one (1) year duration.

##### A.3.3.2.1.3 - Cash Stablecoins [Core]  <!-- UUID: 066a4d9f-13ed-4ac3-a55a-df7bf3429649 -->

Cash Stablecoins are defined as USDC, USDT, and pyUSD.

#### A.3.3.2.2 - Minimum Actively Stabilizing Collateral [Core]  <!-- UUID: 475fe222-9e4a-4e9d-9be6-a7a424ce02f8 -->

Prime Agents must maintain at least 5% of their Collateral Portfolio in Actively Stabilizing Collateral.

##### A.3.3.2.2.1 - Actively Stabilizing Collateral [Core]  <!-- UUID: 62495dee-8d2a-45d4-87c4-01150e3db3c8 -->

Actively Stabilizing Collateral is the sum of (1) Resting Actively Stabilizing Collateral and (2) Latent Actively Stabilizing Collateral.

###### A.3.3.2.2.1.1 - Resting Actively Stabilizing Collateral [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0e17b35a-c830-4695-b63c-5ef58b249d3f -->

Resting Actively Stabilizing Collateral must provide buy support at a price of at least 0.999 USD per USDS (10bps downside spread). Resting Actively Stabilizing Collateral includes Cash Stablecoins in PSMs or decentralized exchanges (e.g., Curve), other stablecoins, crypto assets, or off-chain Real World Asset (RWA) loans to market makers, provided they meet the specified redemption price and transparency requirements.

###### A.3.3.2.2.1.1.1 - Resting Actively Stabilizing Collateral Calculations [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4e8cd2d1-4c74-49fd-b3fe-f8b6ccc1a79f -->

Resting Actively Stabilizing Collateral is currently calculated as the sum of:
    
1. USDC in the LitePSM;
2. USDC in the PSM3 on Base, Arbitrum, Unichain, Optimism;
3. Cash Stablecoins in Curve (paired with USDS);
4. USDC in GUNI 0.01%;
5. USDC in GUNI 0.05%; and
6. Cash Stablecoins in Uniswap (paired with USDS).

###### A.3.3.2.2.1.2 - Latent Actively Stabilizing Collateral [Core]  <!-- UUID: 300d45c5-96b4-47ad-9471-8122534d9bc4 -->

Latent Actively Stabilizing Collateral consists of Cash Stablecoins that do not qualify as Resting Actively Stabilizing Collateral but can be converted to Resting Actively Stabilizing Collateral. Latent Actively Stabilizing Collateral may include Cash Stablecoins deposited into lending protocols, Cash Stablecoins used to provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges, or liquid staking derivatives of cash stablecoins.
Assets must satisfy the following requirements to qualify as Latent Actively Stabilizing Collateral:
    
1. The assets must be verifiable onchain or through reputable APIs or oracles;    
2. The assets must be able to be converted into Resting Actively Stabilizing Collateral within 15 minutes under normal market conditions; and    
3. The process to convert the assets into Resting Actively Stabilizing Collateral must be fully automated and triggered automatically when ASC falls below specified levels.

###### A.3.3.2.2.1.2.1 - Latent Actively Stabilizing Collateral Calculations [Core]  <!-- UUID: 35ce6b38-9fc1-456e-93da-10ab1468a8bf -->

Latent Actively Stabilizing Collateral is currently calculated as the sum of:
    
1. Cash Stablecoins in Curve (not paired with USDS);
2. Cash Stablecoins in Uniswap (not paired with USDS);
3. Cash Stablecoins in SparkLend;
4. Cash Stablecoins in Aave;
5. Cash Stablecoins in Morpho; and
6. Cash Stablecoins in a Prime ALM Proxy.

The Core Executor Agents, in consultation with the Core Council Risk Advisor, may impose limitations on the size of exposures to these protocols or to specific pools within these protocols that qualify as Latent Actively Stabilizing Collateral in order to prevent excessive risk to Sky.

###### A.3.3.2.2.1.2.2 - Maximum Latent Actively Stabilizing Collateral [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5e300cdb-b221-4b6f-9c4a-11502133a1f9 -->

Latent Actively Stabilizing Collateral may not exceed 25% of Actively Stabilizing Collateral.

##### A.3.3.2.2.2 - Penalties For Failing To Satisfy Actively Stabilizing Collateral Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: 51de8003-cdf3-4f86-93a1-1cc3424f299e -->

In the near term there will be no penalties for Prime Agents for failing to maintain the Minimum Actively Stabilizing Collateral. Instead, failures to maintain the Minimum Actively Stabilizing Collateral will be detected and reported as specified in [A.3.3.2.2.2.1 - Reporting Of Failures To Satisfy Actively Stabilizing Collateral Requirement](b74ba49a-de9e-4c4c-866c-b04d9dd208f7).

###### A.3.3.2.2.2.1 - Reporting Of Failures To Satisfy Actively Stabilizing Collateral Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: b74ba49a-de9e-4c4c-866c-b04d9dd208f7 -->

In the near term, the Core Council Risk Advisor must develop a tool to automatically detect and report failures by Prime Agents to maintain the Minimum Actively Stabilizing Collateral. Each violation by a Prime Agent must be reported within 24 hours to the following parties:

- the Core Facilitator;
- Core GovOps;
- the Operational Facilitator for the Prime Agent;
- Operational GovOps for the Prime Agent; and
- the Prime Agent.

In addition, the Core Council Risk Advisor must include a summary of all such violations in the Independent Calculation it prepares as part of each Monthly Settlement Cycle. See [A.2.4.1.2.1.2.2 - Independent Calculation By Core Council Risk Advisor On Behalf Of Core Council](8be8ae66-2453-4d7d-8880-ffaba36bdb7e).

##### A.3.3.2.2.3 - Near Term Exemption For Keel [Core]  <!-- UUID: 864611dd-38cd-493e-b594-a85610a9c63e -->

In the near term, due to limitations in the infrastructure on Solana, Keel is exempt from the requirement to maintain the Minimum Actively Stabilizing Collateral. This exemption will be removed in a future iteration of the Asset Liability Management Framework.

##### A.3.3.2.2.4 - Near Term Actively Stabilizing Collateral Incentive [Core]  <!-- UUID: e5d2d3c1-701c-4420-91a3-d02bc4aa50eb -->

In the near term, Prime Agents are eligible for an Actively Stabilizing Collateral Incentive for fulfilling Actively Stabilizing Collateral requirements.

###### A.3.3.2.2.4.1 - Calculation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 693330d6-9072-4054-bd61-d788537e34e8 -->

The Actively Stabilizing Collateral Incentive is calculated on a per block basis as follows:

`Actively Stabilizing Collateral Incentive = Eligible Actively Stabilizing Collateral * (Base Rate - Treasury Bill Rate)`

The parameters of this formula are defined in [A.3.3.2.2.4.1.1 - Eligible Actively Stabilizing Collateral](e0b95f42-2021-44ab-a979-491a113ccbc1).

###### A.3.3.2.2.4.1.1 - Eligible Actively Stabilizing Collateral [Core]  <!-- UUID: e0b95f42-2021-44ab-a979-491a113ccbc1 -->

The Eligible Actively Stabilizing Collateral is the lesser of (1) the Prime Agent’s Actively Stabilizing Collateral and (2) the Prime Agent’s Minimum Actively Stabilizing Collateral specified in [A.3.3.2.2 - Minimum Actively Stabilizing Collateral](475fe222-9e4a-4e9d-9be6-a7a424ce02f8).

###### A.3.3.2.2.4.1.2 - Base Rate [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0569aabe-179a-42ed-bb9e-24dd0a74408c -->

The Base Rate is specified in [A.3.1.2.1 - Base Rate](228f9955-6bba-4252-a101-5529e7a300b9).

###### A.3.3.2.2.4.1.3 - Treasury Bill Rate [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2edd1333-6ca6-4c10-9d71-80b85d4a4265 -->

The Treasury Bill Rate is, as of any date of determination, the yield (expressed as an annual rate) on United States Treasury Bills having a maturity of ninety-one (91) days (or, if no such maturity is available, such other maturity as the United States Department of the Treasury shall designate as comparable), as published by the United States Department of the Treasury in its Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates (or any successor publication or source designated by the United States Department of the Treasury or, if unavailable, by the Federal Reserve). If such rate is not published on the relevant date, the Treasury Bill Rate shall be the most recently published rate prior to that date.

###### A.3.3.2.2.4.2 - Payment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4ae6189e-231c-4a7f-b3cb-843fe495c2a8 -->

The Actively Stabilizing Collateral Incentive is paid on a monthly basis as part of the Monthly Settlement Cycle.

#### A.3.3.2.3 - Minimum Demand Absorption Buffer [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1e129119-a2ce-4978-b235-c50f2a1c5e2e -->

Every Prime Agent must maintain a Demand Absorption Buffer equal to 25% of their required Actively Stabilizing Collateral.

##### A.3.3.2.3.1 - Demand Absorption Buffer [Core]  <!-- UUID: 104c90df-9236-41bc-a6ee-a6db3e8ef097 -->

To further stabilize USDS during periods of excess supply, Prime Agents must maintain a Demand Absorption Buffer (DAB), a subset of ASC consisting of USDS that is for sale for at most 1.001 USD per USDS. The Demand Absorption Buffer includes USDS or DAI in PSMs. The Demand Absorption Buffer can also be fulfilled by autonomous systems that generate USDS dynamically through the allocation as needed.

##### A.3.3.2.3.2 - Penalties For Failing To Satisfy Demand Absorption Buffer Requirement [Core]  <!-- UUID: eabe411c-6325-4732-8615-8fb9f2037945 -->

The documents herein outline the legacy Peg Stability Module which supported Dai and USDS peg stability under Sky Core management. Going forward, the PSM will be transitioned to Grove.

###### A.3.3.2.7.1.1 - Lite Peg Stability Module [Core]  <!-- UUID: 39473e1a-63f8-433b-a850-08f53b2dcf02 -->

Control of the Lite PSM is being transitioned to Grove. Until this transition is complete, the Lite PSM continues to be controlled by Sky Core, subject to the requirements specified in [A.3.3.2.6 - Sky Core Asset Liability Management Rules](8135523a-dd5f-482d-b522-ec4227746eaf). Post-transition, Grove will manage the Lite PSM as an ASC asset pursuant to the rules defined in this Article.

###### A.3.3.2.7.1.1.1 - Lite Peg Stability Module Parameter Definitions [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9196786a-18b6-4dea-b4e2-852090371dd7 -->

The subdocuments herein define the parameters of the Lite Peg Stability Module.

###### A.3.3.2.7.1.1.1.1 - Lite Peg Stability Module Toll / Fee In Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 12714156-5543-4443-b733-d213db62cecb -->

`tin` is a percentage fee applied when trading the collateral asset into the PSM in exchange for Dai**.**

###### A.3.3.2.7.1.1.1.2 - Lite Peg Stability Module Toll / Fee Out Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: a39b4df8-c022-4bfb-9339-e4d3f38715ec -->

`tout` is the percentage fee applied when trading Dai into the PSM in exchange for the collateral asset.

###### A.3.3.2.7.1.1.1.3 - Lite Peg Stability Module Maximum Debt Ceiling Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: c1805ee8-626e-4aec-9a88-21377579aa3d -->

DC-IAM `line` is the maximum amount of debt the LitePSM can accrue.

###### A.3.3.2.7.1.1.1.3.0.3.1 - Debt Ceiling - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 3b015982-458b-4412-8469-cbcdb4a0b481 -->

The element "Debt Ceiling" refers to the maximum amount that can be borrowed against assets in a vault. Although a PSM has a zero Stability Fee and a liquidation ratio of 100%, it is still a vault and swaps of a collateral asset for Dai represent issuance of Dai that is backed by that collateral asset. The Debt Ceiling serves to limit the exposure the PSM can incur to that collateral asset.

###### A.3.3.2.7.1.1.1.4 - Lite Peg Stability Module Target Available Debt Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7d56c67d-d358-4641-aa27-ada5066c0579 -->

DC-IAM `gap` is the target gap between the debt usage and the Debt Ceiling.

###### A.3.3.2.7.1.1.1.5 - Lite Peg Stability Module Ceiling Increase Cooldown Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 51e64b05-ddb8-4ce3-9307-1f2f8dc51a5f -->

###### A.3.3.2.7.1.1.1.5.0.3.1 - Debt Ceiling - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: f1a64ee3-d89c-4c5e-9559-10bbf4977297 -->

The element "Debt Ceiling" refers to the maximum amount that can be borrowed against assets in a vault. Although a PSM has a zero Stability Fee and a liquidation ratio of 100%, it is still a vault and swaps of a collateral asset for Dai represent issuance of Dai that is backed by that collateral asset. The Debt Ceiling serves to limit the exposure the PSM can incur to that collateral asset.

###### A.3.3.2.7.1.1.1.6 - Lite Peg Stability Module Buffer Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 71776219-5425-4eaf-89fe-7dea283d5a7d -->

`buf` is a fixed-sized amount of pre-minted Dai which LitePSM is designed to maintain in most situations. Note, however, that when a user calls `buyGem`, the amount of Dai available can be temporarily larger than `buf`.

###### A.3.3.2.7.1.1.1.6.0.3.1 - BuyGem - Element Annotation [Annotation]  <!-- UUID: 41d9ae0a-c3a6-4a24-ae6a-b2ee841fb03d -->

`buyGem` is a function that can be called on the LitePSM smart contract to buy a collateral asset in exchange for Dai. "Gem" here is Daiwanese for the collateral token.

The Lite Peg Stability Module maintains a pool of pre-minted Dai and Stablecoins to minimize transaction costs in swapping. The `buf` parameter is the amount of pre-minted Dai the LitePSM is designed to maintain in most instances. However, when a user calls `buyGem` and buys the collateral asset in exchange for Dai, the amount of Dai can temporarily exceed the `buf` parameter.

###### A.3.3.2.7.1.1.1.7 - Lite Peg Stability Module Authorized Parties Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: 12d3a162-9615-4bc0-ae09-57e0cd3af222 -->

###### A.3.3.2.7.2.1 - Andromeda [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1b153f9f-7c70-4ae1-b76c-ef12f87532c6 -->

Historically, Andromeda balanced Sky Core’s Cash Stablecoin liquidity by allocating excess into low-risk treasury strategies and replenishing shortages. Control of the Andromeda RWA Arranged Structure is currently being transitioned to Grove. Until the transition to Grove is complete, Andromeda continues to be controlled by Sky Core, subject to the requirements defined in [A.3.3.2.6 - Sky Core Asset Liability Management Rules](8135523a-dd5f-482d-b522-ec4227746eaf). Post-transition, Grove will manage Andromeda as a non-ASC asset within its Collateral Portfolio, subject to JRC requirements. Andromeda is not currently operational and its debt ceiling has been reduced to zero.

###### A.3.3.2.7.2.2 - Other RWA Offboarding [Core]  <!-- UUID: ca876157-5518-4bf3-9e87-7c4a07a13d36 -->

Other than Andromeda, all old RWA exposure that was added before Endgame must stay for as long as necessary, and optimized for yield if possible. When it is possible, the Stability Facilitators should take action to wind down and offboard all such Legacy RWA. Governance actions related to optimizations, wind down and offboardings can be done directly in Executive Votes with no prior Governance Poll needed.

## A.3.4 - Real World Assets [Article]  <!-- UUID: edd96df7-4058-4a74-a6e5-827df31e5fdd -->

This Article governs the secure management of Real World Assets (RWA), which serve as collateral for the USDS Stablecoin. RWAs are enforced through legal recourse by Arranged Structures and present unique risks that this Article must address.

### A.3.4.1 - Arranged Structures [Section]  <!-- UUID: 1df6a6c4-4f2e-451b-af0d-5c9eccc8762d -->

Arranged Structures are special legal structures set up by Ecosystem Actors to secure Real World Assets to help stabilize the Sky Ecosystem. Each Arranged Structure has a Conduit system which is owned by an Agent and automatically connected to all Agents; the Conduit allows them to send and receive USDS or other assets.

### A.3.4.2 - Agent Owner For Arranged Structures [Section]  <!-- UUID: 2f1ab584-bb48-4588-a4ff-a4ff0e728c89 -->

Arranged Structures must have an Agent owner. The Agent owner assigns instructions to the Arranged Structure on behalf of Sky, and determines if and how other Agents can access the Conduit of the Arranged Structure.

### A.3.4.3 - Arrangers [Section]  <!-- UUID: 12c9e05d-b47f-456f-aff9-ddece22cec62 -->

This Section defines procedures related to Arrangers, Ecosystem Actors that assist in the design and operation of Arranged Structures. Every Arranged Structure must have a designated Arranger responsible for conducting ongoing reporting. All aspects of this relationship, including the Arranger's duties, must be defined in this Section.

#### A.3.4.3.1 - Introduction [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4b110433-bf28-4c9a-b709-e2deaac9212e -->

Arrangers are Ecosystem Actors who specialize in sourcing, negotiating, structuring, and reporting on Real World Assets, as well as maintaining and monitoring the underlying Arranged Structures used by the Sky Protocol. The Arrangers manage a restricted function on the Arranged Structure Conduit that allows them to send assets onwards to the predetermined blockchain account of the Arranged Structure.

Arrangers are generally prohibited from occupying any position where they could cause damage or loss to the Sky Ecoystem, notwithstanding delays or inconveniences.

After the Arranged Structures are established and assets are allocated, Arrangers must not have the capability to operate or influence the legal and operational structure’s asset operations in any manner that could cause significant harm or losses to the stability of USDS. 

Arrangers are directly approved by SKY voters, and all LRA collateral exposure must be structured by an approved Arranger.

#### A.3.4.3.2 - Onboarding And Offboarding of Arrangers [Core]  <!-- UUID: 769c492c-2282-4466-8d24-0a530f724a0c -->

#### A.3.4.3.3 - Reporting And Stress Test Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: a904881f-b235-4236-8439-deea105f06d0 -->

Arrangers must publish monthly reporting on each Arranged Structure they have arranged. 

Every six (6) months, Arrangers are also required to publish a stress test analysis that demonstrates how the structures would perform under historical financial crisis scenarios and other hypothetical scenarios.

The Stability Facilitators must periodically fund independent Ecosystem Actors to review and verify the quality and the results of the stress tests. Should an independent review produce an unfavorable result, the Stability Facilitators must propose a Governance Poll for warning, temporarily deactivating, or permanently offboarding the Arranger and/or the Asset Managers connected to the discovered issue.

To be considered compliant, Arrangers’ monthly reports must satisfy the requirements of one of the following documents:

-[A.3.4.3.3.1 - Monthly Arranger Report Requirements](7b902bb1-68b4-477d-a575-29aaa02e9e7b)

If these dates fall on days when markets are closed, the first business day after the start date and the last business day before the end date may be used instead.

- Cash balance.

- Cash income over the reporting period. Any income over $20,000 in value should be broken out as its own line item, and an explanation provided for any non-recurring or non-ordinary expenses.

- Cash expenses over the reporting period. Any expense over $20,000 in value should be broken out as its own line item, and an explanation provided for any non-recurring or non-ordinary expenses.

- Market value of publicly traded equities, ETFs, and mutual funds.

- Market value (the closing price) of publicly traded debt securities. Debt securities that are investment grade and less than 12 months from maturity may alternatively be reported at cost basis + linearly recognizing scheduled interest income.

- A valuation for illiquid or privately traded assets. This should utilize a valuation from a reputable third party with relevant expertise or follow a well-defined methodology that is explained in detail in the report.

- CUSIPs, date of purchase, date of maturity, coupon, cost basis, and face value of all publicly traded debt securities in the portfolio for the last day of the reporting period.

- USDS inflows from the Sky Protocol during the reporting period.

- Total repayments on-chain to the Sky Protocol either to a vault or for surplus. If repayments are derived from multiple sources, they should be broken out into line items for each source.

- Vault debt to the Sky Protocol.

- Copies of original statements for all bank, brokerage, exchange, custodial, or other accounts. The Arranger may redact the names for non-Arranger service providers if and only if that is a requirement of confidentiality agreements with the non-Arranger service providers.

The Stability Facilitator must publicly confirm on the Sky Forum that they have reviewed the original account documentation and verified that it supports the Arranger’s summary.

##### A.3.4.3.3.2 - Access To Accounts [Core]  <!-- UUID: 47eedd39-5bb9-492f-a4aa-9405bb5d196f -->

- All asset balances

- All transaction amounts (non-Arranger service provider names may be redacted)

- Hold-to-maturity yields (for assets with maturity) or current yield (for assets with no maturity)

In addition, Makerburn.com ([https://makerburn.com/#/](https://makerburn.com/#/)), Daistats.com ([https://daistats.com/#/](https://daistats.com/#/)), or another dashboard must be publicly available to summarize USDS inflows and outflows from the Sky vault.

### A.3.4.4 - Agent Owner Can Change Arrangers [Section]  <!-- UUID: cb2098b0-9970-4a5b-b835-eaa4f0e2ea6f -->

##### A.3.5.3.1.3 - Allocated Genesis Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: c3b6546e-48f9-42ac-9a6c-524ed7ac91cb -->

Allocated Genesis Capital is the negative of the Surplus Buffer. Allocated Genesis Capital represents the funds Sky Core has deployed into the Genesis Agents to bootstrap innovation and Agent diversity.

#### A.3.5.3.2 - Capital Types [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3b829981-2fe0-49dd-bfef-8a44edc9514d -->

The documents herein define capital targets for Sky and processes for achieving those targets over time.

##### A.3.5.3.2.1 - Target Aggregate Backstop Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: f73dda95-0b1c-4bdc-b957-469253d27281 -->

The current Target Aggregate Backstop Capital is 125 million USDS.

##### A.3.5.3.2.2 - Capital Retention To Achieve Target Aggregate Backstop Capital [Core]  <!-- UUID: ae3b42cd-cdda-424a-b09a-87e2796538ba -->

When Aggregate Backstop Capital is below Target Aggregate Backstop Capital, Sky Governance will retain 25% of Net Revenue (see [A.2.3.1.2.1 - Step 0: Net Revenue](c09435ff-d876-442a-899c-ad494175500b)) to grow Aggregate Backstop Capital. In the short term, this is implemented on a monthly basis by Sky Governance by adjusting the parameters of the Treasury Management System and the Smart Burn Engine.

## A.3.6 - SKY Backstop [Article]  <!-- UUID: 4d8b0d82-97da-4041-b185-4b98c2779cbe -->

This Article governs the SKY Backstop. If the USDS Stablecoin becomes undercollateralized, the Sky Protocol will automatically generate and sell SKY to recapitalize the system. The period when the recapitalization mechanism is actively minting and selling SKY to close the shortfall is termed a "SKY Backstop Event."

### A.3.6.1 - Emission Rate [Section]  <!-- UUID: 463b58c0-79fa-4e50-85e6-20560f3da9a3 -->

An emissions rate for the SKY backstop function that prevents risk of sudden failure must be defined. This must be continuously assessed and improved to maximize stability of the system in worst case scenarios.

#### A.3.6.1.1 - Limitless [Core]  <!-- UUID: 193d8b40-bb67-4f22-b452-845e63481737 -->

The SKY Backstop is temporarily limitless.

### A.3.6.2 - Maximum Level Of Emission [Section]  <!-- UUID: 0e898ec0-e618-4deb-a7cb-f5ca47c00e71 -->

A maximum level of SKY emission per undercollateralization event must be defined. This must be continuously assessed and improved to maximize stability of the system in worst-case scenarios.

### A.3.6.3 - Override Mechanism [Section]  <!-- UUID: ed24e054-5c3f-4fc5-9992-d19462a47052 -->

The Protocol must include an override mechanism that allows Sky Governance to continue emitting SKY beyond the maximum level. This Section must specify research processes and principles to guide when and how the override mechanism can be safely used.

### A.3.6.4 - Halt Mechanism [Section]  <!-- UUID: 28f36566-e26e-4b51-bf68-f6ddd584c172 -->

The Protocol must contain a SKY backstop halt mechanism that immediately halts the backstop event in case of severe risk of total failure.

### A.3.6.5 - Mitigate Worst Case Scenario [Section]  <!-- UUID: 1008d9c7-98be-4fde-9473-5a5441160a20 -->

In case the backstop limit is reached and not overridden, or in case the backstop is halted during the event, the USDS target price receives a haircut to settle the remaining bad debt of the system. This Section must define elements and infrastructure to address this worst-case scenario, including research concerning ways to mitigate damage.

### A.3.6.6 - Relation To Genesis Capital Backstop [Section]  <!-- UUID: 5e795fa2-77d7-4f2a-8494-545d4bb2d955 -->

##### A.3.7.1.1.2 - Risk Parameter Definitions [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8eb26d06-d2b3-493f-a79f-e3509326ddc6 -->

The Native Vault Engine risk parameters are defined in the subdocuments herein.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.1 - Liquidation Ratio [Core]  <!-- UUID: 9ce4d08e-aa5b-4cab-884e-7a53e937bdb8 -->

The Liquidation Ratio parameter limits the maximum amount of Dai debt that a vault user can draw from their vault given the value of their collateral locked in that vault. In practice, it expresses the minimum collateral in percentage terms that can support a given Dai debt. If the ratio of a Vault user's collateral to their debt drops below this value, their vault can be liquidated. Each vault type has its own Liquidation Ratio. The Liquidation Ratio for each vault type is expressed as a percentage value of the collateral that must be present in the vault to support its debt.

Changes to the Liquidation Ratio are subject to the Operational Weekly Cycle, requiring a Governance Poll followed by an Executive Vote.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.2 - Debt Ceiling Limit [Core]  <!-- UUID: b490d4d0-8eb8-4dc6-9ef3-c85d357f1f4b -->

The Debt Ceiling Limit is numerically provided and acts as an upper limit. Core GovOps, in consultation with the Core Council Risk Advisor, can propose changes within this limit. 

Debt Ceiling Limit = Unlimited is defined as large enough to avoid being reached in the near future. 

The DC-IAM methodology contained in [A.3.7.1.1.2.4 - Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM)](93c9f662-4e0d-477e-8fc9-e3726877e842) acts as a risk mitigation tool. It limits the rate at which exposure can increase in a short period of time in the event of an unexpected emergency.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.3 - Stability Fee [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0257a420-e92e-4942-b794-a559f299365f -->

The Stability Fee parameter is an annual percentage fee charged on the Dai generated on Vaults. It is expressed as an annual percentage yield but it is charged on a per-block basis in Dai. The Dai from this fee is minted, added to the Dai debt for the vault, and then transferred into the Surplus Buffer which is under the control of Sky Governance. Each vault type has its own Stability Fee that can be adjusted independently.

The Stability Fees can be modified through either Executive Votes or the Stability Parameter Bounded External Access Module. See [A.3.7.1.3 - Stability Parameter Bounded External Access Module](47b8b035-8abd-42e6-86b8-33f852fa953a). 

The Stability Fees must be gradually increased over time to incentivize users to migrate to SparkLend and other borrowing platforms offered by Prime Agents.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.4 - Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 93c9f662-4e0d-477e-8fc9-e3726877e842 -->

The DC-IAM allows any user to adjust the Debt Ceiling of a supported vault type according to the rules defined in the DC-IAM smart contract logic and parameters set by the Stability Facilitators. The DC-IAM holds three parameters that can be set by Sky Governance for each vault type, (i) Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`), (ii) Target Available Debt (`gap`), and (iii) Ceiling Increase Cooldown (`ttl`).

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.4.1 - Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6ba18f25-dae8-4fa5-929e-3c7071b70107 -->

The `line` parameter refers to the maximum value for the Debt Ceiling that the DC-IAM will allow in the given vault type. When using the DC-IAM to manage the Debt Ceiling of a vault type, the `line` parameter essentially replaces the Debt Ceiling parameter for that vault type. Rather than Sky Governance setting the Debt Ceiling directly, they will need to set the Maximum Debt Ceiling `line` in the DC-IAM. The `line` parameter is defined in Dai.

The Maximum Debt Ceiling is defined in [A.3.7.1.1.2.2 - Debt Ceiling Limit](b490d4d0-8eb8-4dc6-9ef3-c85d357f1f4b) and is currently unlimited.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.4.2 - Target Available Debt (gap) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 07353080-4346-4ffd-bfc8-913cac78776a -->

The `gap` parameter controls how much of a gap the DC-IAM aims to maintain between the current debt usage and the Debt Ceiling of the vault type. The higher this value, the more risk there is from large collateral drops in very short amounts of time. The smaller this value, the more vault use is negatively affected. The `gap` parameter is defined in Dai.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.4.3 - Ceiling Increase Cooldown (ttl) [Core]  <!-- UUID: a5ae79ad-9460-41a3-8dbf-65605f54b79b -->

The Ceiling Increase Cooldown (`ttl`) parameter controls how frequently the Debt Ceiling can be increased by the DC-IAM. If a user attempts to use the DC-IAM to increase the Debt Ceiling of a vault type before this time expires, the transaction will fail to execute and the Debt Ceiling will remain unchanged. The `ttl` parameter in combination with the `gap` parameter enforces a maximum rate at which debt usage can increase over time using a given vault type. These parameters should be set such that the maximum increase over time can accommodate all reasonable usage of the vault type in question. The `ttl` parameter is defined in seconds.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.5 - Auction Parameters [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5774fd7c-ecd9-46ea-b33d-77ea9c6de4f3 -->

A clear justification and analysis must be provided to validate any proposed changes to the parameters specified in this document. Before these changes are added to an Executive Vote, Core GovOps, in consultation with the Core Council Risk Advisor, must obtain approval through a Governance Poll. However, in an emergency, Core GovOps, in consultation with the Core Council Risk Advisor, has the authority to bypass the Governance Poll and add the proposed parameters directly to an Executive Vote. The parameters contained herein must be regularly monitored and updated if needed.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.5.1 - Auction Price Function (calc) [Core]  <!-- UUID: fc7341c8-5a58-4be4-be8c-201f858e3861 -->

The Auction Price Function is the mathematical function that determines how the collateral price changes over time during a collateral auction. Collateral auctions use a falling price auction, where the price starts high and decreases according to the function defined in this parameter. 

The Exponential Stair Step function contains two key parameters, `cut` and `step`, defined in [A.3.7.1.1.2.5.1.1 - Auction Price Function (cut)](1ff3ceac-abd0-4195-9a60-a4aaf48c3d31) and [A.3.7.1.1.2.5.1.2 - Auction Price Function (step)](4b46633c-4d6c-4a9c-9be0-93d242ce9db9), respectively.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.5.1.1 - Auction Price Function (cut) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1ff3ceac-abd0-4195-9a60-a4aaf48c3d31 -->

The `cut` parameter controls the ‘depth’ of each step in the function. A smaller `cut` means a smoother line; a large one means more pronounced steps. The `cut` parameter is defined as a multiplicative factor. For example, 0.99 equated to a 1% price drop.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.5.1.2 - Auction Price Function (step) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4b46633c-4d6c-4a9c-9be0-93d242ce9db9 -->

The `step` parameter controls the length of time between price drops. A smaller step means a smoother line; a large one means more pronounced steps. The `step` parameter is defined in seconds.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.5.2 - Auction Price Multiplier (buf) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2bcdc1c9-6e43-4059-8a46-0a68c17f487d -->

The `buf` parameter is a multiplier that is applied to the starting price of a collateral auction. Each vault type has its own Auction Price Multiplier that can be adjusted by Sky Governance separately. This multiplier is intended to be greater than 1.0x because Liquidations 2.0 uses falling price auctions. This means that it is generally preferable for the auction price to begin above the market price and then fall to the correct value over some amount of time. The `buf` parameter is defined as a multiplicative factor.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.5.3 - Max Auction Drawdown (cusp) [Core]  <!-- UUID: fc472dd5-3c2a-4335-ad2f-4988dbeb1c89 -->

The Max Auction Drawdown is the maximum percentage drop in collateral price during a collateral auction before the auction is reset. 'Collateral price' in this context refers to the collateral auction price rather than the collateral market price.

The Max Auction Drawdown parameter overlaps with the Max Auction Duration parameter in that an auction will need to be reset once either maximum is exceeded.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.5.4 - Max Auction Duration (tail) [Core]  <!-- UUID: cd5a3cb9-e658-4bc5-8f82-b4dab52f32d9 -->

The Max Auction Duration parameter sets the maximum time that can elapse before an auction needs to reset for a particular vault type. Expressed in seconds, this parameter determines when an auction can no longer settle and must be reset.

The Max Auction Duration parameter overlaps with the Max Auction Drawdown parameter in that an auction will need to be reset once either maximum is exceeded.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.5.5 - Proportional Kick Incentive (chip) [Core]  <!-- UUID: e92d5797-9d72-455b-95a3-7fca9bb68071 -->

The Proportional Kick Incentive parameter represents a reward in Dai paid to the keepers that trigger collateral liquidation auctions in the Sky Protocol. The Proportional Kick Incentive is set as a percentage and represents a portion of Dai based on the debt of the vault that is being liquidated. The Dai is rewarded for each liquidation auction at the point the auction is triggered. Each vault type has its own Proportional Kick Incentive that may be adjusted separately by Sky Governance.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.5.6 - Flat Kick Incentive (tip) [Core]  <!-- UUID: e883adc9-b624-438b-8a4b-981ffe741478 -->

The Flat Kick Incentive parameter represents a reward in Dai paid to the keepers that trigger collateral liquidation auctions in the Sky Protocol. The Flat Kick Incentive is a fixed amount of Dai that is rewarded for each liquidation auction at the point the auction is triggered. Each vault type has its own Flat Kick Incentive that may be adjusted separately by Sky Governance.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.5.7 - Liquidation Penalty (chop) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7f2f2eba-1933-4974-8436-54372d3188b1 -->

The Liquidation Penalty parameter controls the fee vault owners must pay when their position is liquidated due to insufficient collateral. For a vault holder to receive any collateral back from the liquidations process, the debt and Liquidation Penalty must be covered by the collateral auction. Each vault type has its own Liquidation Penalty that can be adjusted by Sky Governance.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.5.8 - Local Liquidation Limit (hole) [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5d10220e-0541-4537-82d2-d853fa65ec97 -->

The Local Liquidation Limit sets the maximum amount of Dai debt for which collateral auctions can be active at any one time within a particular vault type. When the total Dai value of auctions exceeds this maximum for a particular vault type, no more collateral can be auctioned using that vault type until others are completed. Each vault type has a separate Local Liquidation Limit.

###### A.3.7.1.1.2.6 - Debt Floor (dust) [Core]  <!-- UUID: d6e0c32d-aea2-4bc7-9ec3-97d54bdbd9a7 -->

The Debt Floor parameter controls the minimum amount of Dai that can be minted using a specific vault type for an individual vault. If a user tries to mint Dai and the amount of Dai minted would not put the vault's amount of Dai minted above its Debt Floor, the transaction will fail and no DAi will be minted. Likewise, if a user attempts to pay back debt such that their debt will equal less than the Debt Floor and greater than zero, the transaction will fail and no Dai will be paid back. Each vault type has its own Debt Floor that can be adjusted by Sky Governance.

#### A.3.7.1.5 - Offboarding Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3da8a0fd-952c-4f80-b674-f60c9a293cb9 -->

The subdocuments herein define the process by which Sky vault users should be notified about collateral offboarding.

##### A.3.7.1.5.1 - Legacy Context [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6e08fc61-dc0d-4f18-8f4d-faa75f7dc59a -->

Periodically, collateral and vault types (ilks) are re-evaluated, which sometimes results in an offboarding of that collateral or vault type. 

There have been several instances where users entered official Sky forums/chats to understand why they had been suddenly liquidated, despite historically comfortable collateralization ratios ([https://forum.sky.money/t/an-assessment-first-hand-experience-and-recommendations-from-the-aave-offboarding/11836](https://forum.sky.money/t/an-assessment-first-hand-experience-and-recommendations-from-the-aave-offboarding/11836)). This is, understandably, a poor user experience. 

Even with liquidation penalties set to 0%, the forced unwinding of levered positions conceivably can result in user losses, as well as potentially taxable events. 

This Section defines procedures concerning the dissemination of information about upcoming collateral offboarding on a best-effort basis. The objective is to minimize the number of users who are unaware of the offboarding prior to getting their positions liquidated.

###### A.3.7.1.5.1.1 - Legacy Context Specific Goals [Core]  <!-- UUID: dd7c5813-2026-4d1c-9bc8-33cf8fbee15a -->

Specific Goals:

1. Codify a series of good-faith communication efforts.

2. Provide an easy-to-follow process for Sky contributors to follow without significant burden.

3. Minimize the number of users unaware of a collateral offboarding.

4. Provide a method to bypass these requirements in the event a collateral is being offboarded due to serious security or solvency concerns.

##### A.3.7.1.5.2 - Technical Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 305e2bd6-a594-4aec-8713-adbe7bc87120 -->

The subdocuments herein specify actions to be taken by specific actors within Sky when offboarding a vault type.

###### A.3.7.1.5.2.1 - Immediate Actions [Core]  <!-- UUID: 200a9e67-ed5d-4d60-b826-860a2a247dcc -->

Upon approval by Sky Governance to offboard a permissionless collateral type or vault type, the following actions are taken as soon as is practicable:

- Set debt ceiling to zero (0) Dai or USDS.

- Make an initial public announcement on all communication channels listed in [A.3.7.1.5.3.0.6.1 - Communication Channels And Media Assets Listing](9ac8a70b-8b6a-4825-a5e0-5e9019e50bc4).

- Make a second public announcement on all communication channels in the above cited document no later than 14 calendar days after the initial public announcement.

- Once the second public announcements have been made, set the liquidation penalty to 0%.

###### A.3.7.1.5.2.2 - Following Actions [Core]  <!-- UUID: e0891d48-c684-4372-96e8-988aba8cccee -->

Parameter changes designed to offboard users, such as changes to the liquidation ratio or stability fee, can only be implemented once 14 calendar days have passed following a second public announcement.

##### A.3.7.1.5.3 - Communication Channels And Media Assets [Active Data Controller]  <!-- UUID: 9d418790-3081-43b4-a6f6-1c49ff5b4be8 -->

The process for adding, removing, and modifying communication channels and media assets, and the order of announcement publication, are defined as Active Data in [A.3.7.1.5.3.0.6.1 - Communication Channels And Media Assets Listing](9ac8a70b-8b6a-4825-a5e0-5e9019e50bc4).

The Active Data is updated as follows:

- The Responsible Party is Core GovOps.

- The Update Process must follow the protocol for ‘Direct Edit’.

###### A.3.7.1.5.3.0.6.1 - Communication Channels And Media Assets Listing [Active Data]  <!-- UUID: 9ac8a70b-8b6a-4825-a5e0-5e9019e50bc4 -->

The following channels should be used for initial and second public announcements of collateral offboarding. The order of announcement publication is as follows:

1. The author of the collateral offboarding notice shall post to the Sky Forum detailing the recommended offboarding. This forum thread is used to inform downstream announcements on other channels.

2. Core GovOps publishes the associated notices to:

- All public Sky Calendars

- The Sky Official Discord’s Announcement channel.

- The official Sky subreddit.

3. Partner Relationship Leads from relevant Ecosystem Actors reach out to:

- Affected collateral partners (e.g., Aave)

- Affected frontend service providers (e.g., Oasis, DeFi Saver)

Additionally, outreach may be done to cover more channels not listed here. These may include other Ecosystem Actor or Facilitator owned Twitter accounts, communication channels, and platforms.

Unless otherwise noted in [A.3.7.1.5 - Offboarding Process](3da8a0fd-952c-4f80-b674-f60c9a293cb9) and its subdocuments, Core GovOps will take the lead in coordinating channels announcements.

##### A.3.7.1.5.4 - Expedited Offboarding [Core]  <!-- UUID: f9894690-fb43-431c-84ae-c6f5886745e9 -->

The subdocuments herein define an expedited offboarding process in the event a collateral type needs to be removed quickly due to security or solvency concerns.

###### A.3.7.1.5.4.1 - Requirements [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5f2109db-6680-478b-b72a-45f30065b626 -->

When a collateral type threatens the security or solvency of the Sky Protocol, an expedited offboarding is in order. Expedited offboardings override the timeline specified in [A.3.7.1.5.2 - Technical Process](305e2bd6-a594-4aec-8713-adbe7bc87120) and allow the immediate modification of all relevant parameters.

Expedited offboardings must proceed pursuant to the following requirements:

- The Offboarding Proposal must state that the offboarding should be expedited due to an emergency or urgent concern, as defined in [A.1.8.1.1 - Definition Of Emergency Situations](5eafb29e-84a0-4a53-a798-3f958c880225)**.**

- The Offboarding Proposal must explicitly reference this Atlas document.

###### A.3.7.1.5.4.2 - Announcements [Core]  <!-- UUID: b83a3a8b-a5ab-4eed-abf0-31842ebbfa29 -->

The public announcements defined in [A.3.7.1.5.2 - Technical Process](305e2bd6-a594-4aec-8713-adbe7bc87120) must still be carried out. However, the timing of these announcements no longer constrains the modification of parameters. These announcements must also state that the offboarding is being expedited and explain the reasons for this accelerated process.

#### A.3.7.1.6 - Genesis Capital Backstop [Core]  <!-- UUID: a9965d58-8cda-49fc-8a7f-f8cc2e0d6b98 -->

If a "SKY Backstop Event" is in progress and the SKY price equals zero, the Sky Protocol must apply a pro‑rata haircut across each Genesis Agent’s Genesis Capital, implemented as a transfer of eligible assets from each Agent to the Sky Surplus Buffer. The haircut must be sized exactly to restore the Surplus Buffer to zero.

##### A.3.7.1.6.1 - Implementation [Core]  <!-- UUID: 4381df75-0d4f-4f17-a263-f796cc33be27 -->

In the near term, transfers are made through Executive Votes and may be made through Emergency Spells (see [A.1.9.5 - Emergency Spells](b8266c11-3a84-4bbe-abe2-de9474f74ffd)) as part of the Emergency Response System (see [A.1.8.1 - Emergency Response](20dcf582-8862-48b3-9ca9-c3703871bd14)).

A solution must be developed to allow these transfers to be accomplished on an automated basis without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay (see [A.1.9.3 - Governance Security Delay Requirements](c5f0e955-0441-42e0-a6fc-eab875bba568)).

##### A.3.7.1.6.2 - Post Backstop Settlement [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1edfed11-0234-4d15-b52b-37d7493565cd -->

If the haircut restores the Surplus Buffer to zero (i.e., the deficit is fully cleared), Sky will distribute 24 billion SKY to Genesis Agents, in proportion to the amount each Agent lost in the haircut.

If, after the haircut, the Surplus Buffer remains below zero (i.e., the deficit could not be fully cleared), Sky will adjust the USDS target price below $1 to the extent necessary to settle the remaining deficit; Sky will then distribute 24 billion SKY to USDS holders via an airdrop.

##### A.3.7.1.6.3 - Genesis Agent Capital Shortfalls [Core]  <!-- UUID: 81bacfed-5cc9-4980-bf71-1e5edcbdadba -->

Transfers of capital from Genesis Agents may cause capital shortfalls for Genesis Agents under the Risk Framework (see [A.3.2 - Risk Capital](55999acf-75fe-4adf-8584-9746ef50d3e4)). Sky will work in good faith with such Agents to waive penalties for a reasonable period of time to allow the Agents to rebuild their capital.

##### A.3.7.1.6.4 - Relation To SKY Backstop [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3b7324cd-8246-4eed-9da9-56599dcac5b4 -->

The Genesis Capital Backstop may not be invoked unless a "SKY Backstop Event" is in progress and the price of SKY equals zero.

##### A.3.7.1.6.5 - Genesis Agents [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8952aac5-24fb-4da1-ae10-49f86d30aecd -->

Genesis Agents are Agents that receive capital contributions from Sky, including, without limitation:
    
- Spark    
- Grove    
- Keel    
- Skybase

The Protocol Scope regulates the maintenance and development of the core Sky Protocol and its critical, non-collateral components. The Protocol Scope defines all rules for protocol engineering.

## A.4.1 - Core Tokens [Article]  <!-- UUID: e5089a2a-22b0-47fd-b0c2-a93017a2c71a -->

The two core tokens, USDS and SKY, play the central role in the usability and tokenomics of the Sky Ecosystem.

### A.4.1.1 - USDS [Section]  <!-- UUID: 7e356a45-3d05-4125-9fd7-d3d454e54cdb -->

USDS is the Stablecoin product of the Sky Protocol. It is designed to remain stable against USD, and its supply is regulated through the Peg Stability Module and the Allocation System, as governed by the Stability Scope.

#### A.4.1.1.1 - USDS Launch [Core]  <!-- UUID: 3e00cf4d-8b10-4182-bb3d-08b63bc55aeb -->

In the Endgame Token Launch Phase, USDS was launched as an upgrade to Dai, offering new features, including Token Rewards. Dai can be exchanged to and from USDS at a rate of 1:1.

##### A.4.1.1.1.1 - Gnosis Payment [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8f721d05-6f9b-4efe-b737-18f634f9703d -->

Sky has agreed to compensate Gnosis for the difference between the Sky Savings Rate and the Dai Savings Rate on xDai balances for the period between March 1, 2025 and October 28, 2025.

The amount of this payment is 1,806,670 USDS and the recipient address on the Ethereum Mainnet is `0x849d52316331967b6ff1198e5e32a0eb168d039d`. This payment should be included in the next available Executive Vote as determined by the Core Facilitator and is authorized to proceed directly to an Executive Vote without a prior Governance Poll.

### A.4.1.2 - SKY [Section]  <!-- UUID: 8e505278-67d9-4c89-afe4-992d5d846fb8 -->

SKY is the governance token of the Sky Protocol. It grants voting rights in the Sky Governance system. Its liquidity is boosted by the Smart Burn Engine, as governed by the Stability Scope.

#### A.4.1.2.1 - MKR To SKY Upgrade [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6bb8b5b2-a2a8-4728-bddb-28bf054de9b6 -->

Historically, MKR was the governance token of the Sky Protocol. As part of the transition to the Endgame, the technical infrastructure of the Sky Protocol was upgraded to use SKY as its governance token rather than MKR.

##### A.4.1.2.1.1 - MKR To SKY Upgrade Approval [Core]  <!-- UUID: eaa5f1ae-f336-49f8-b5d3-7bb01984ba0e -->

**MKR holders have voted to approve the deprecation of MKR as the governance token of the Sky Protocol with full knowledge of the changes being proposed. See **[**https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmcZNZg3**](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmcZNZg3)**. This deprecation includes all actions defined in **[**A.4.1.2.1 - MKR To SKY Upgrade**](6bb8b5b2-a2a8-4728-bddb-28bf054de9b6)**, including, but not limited to, the removal of voting rights from MKR and the Delayed Upgrade Penalty**.

###### A.4.1.2.1.1.1 - MKR To SKY Conversion Contract [Core]  <!-- UUID: 0a26f6d0-1b50-4015-b094-499724796f9e -->

The MKR to SKY conversion contract MKR_SKY allows users to upgrade from MKR to SKY at a conversion rate of 1 MKR to 24,000 SKY, subject to the Delayed Upgrade Penalty specified in [A.4.1.2.1.1.1.1 - MKR To SKY Upgrade Penalty](ec820ddb-5d12-43d8-81b7-a7602a70332a).

###### A.4.1.2.1.1.1.1 - MKR To SKY Upgrade Penalty [Core]  <!-- UUID: ec820ddb-5d12-43d8-81b7-a7602a70332a -->

In the September 18, 2025 Executive Vote, the Delayed Upgrade Penalty for the MKR to SKY conversion contract was set to 1%. The Delayed Upgrade Penalty will be increased gradually at the rate of 1 percentage point per 3 months thereafter.

#### A.4.1.2.2 - Deflationary Tokenomics [Core]  <!-- UUID: c72ca16f-14d1-4aca-978e-ba9efe6d80bc -->

The documents herein set forth the core deflationary tokenomics of the SKY token.

##### A.4.1.2.2.1 - Initial Token Supply [Core]  <!-- UUID: fd196f2c-c36f-479f-9254-c03c8886b559 -->

The initial token supply of SKY tokens is derived from the total number of legacy MKR tokens as of the launch of Sky, multiplied by the conversion ratio of 24,000. SKY is the exclusive governance token of the Sky Protocol and takes over all governance and economic rights previously held by MKR. See [A.4.1.2.1 - MKR To SKY Upgrade](6bb8b5b2-a2a8-4728-bddb-28bf054de9b6).

##### A.4.1.2.2.2 - No New Token Emissions [Core]  <!-- UUID: 60519e2c-77f7-43ed-8eb4-a7b138bebf2d -->

No new SKY tokens may be emitted except for (1) emissions required to recapitalize the protocol if it is at risk of insolvency (see [A.3.6 - SKY Backstop](4d8b0d82-97da-4041-b185-4b98c2779cbe)) and (2) temporary emissions that are being deprecated and fully offset by corresponding burns, resulting in no net increase to the intended long-term token supply (see [A.4.1.2.2.4 - Deprecated Emissions Mechanisms](2f3962e4-c79e-4583-82df-31239dfb84a4)).

##### A.4.1.2.2.3 - Burning Of Existing Tokens [Core]  <!-- UUID: 5b94d42a-28fa-40fa-8948-ba3113a4d5b8 -->

At the same time that no new SKY tokens are issued, SKY tokens are bought back and burned on a regular basis, using a portion of the Net Revenue of the Protocol as dictated by the Treasury Management Function. See [A.2.3.1.2.5.1 - Smart Burn Buffer](c2a0ca01-ffea-46ee-8077-e46e0510d097). As a result, the total supply of SKY tokens will continue to decrease over time.

##### A.4.1.2.2.4 - Deprecated Emissions Mechanisms [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2f3962e4-c79e-4583-82df-31239dfb84a4 -->

The subdocuments herein define legacy mechanisms involving the issuance of new SKY tokens. Each of these mechanisms has been deprecated. While these mechanisms did not increase the net supply of SKY tokens, they have been replaced with solutions that do not involve any emissions of SKY tokens, as defined in the documents herein.

###### A.4.1.2.2.4.1 - SKY Token Rewards Emissions [Core]  <!-- UUID: 8189e776-d631-44a0-81e5-3b2d5d88ef54 -->

USDS users may be able to earn SKY Rewards. See [A.4.3.2 - Token Reward Mechanism](3ff5a7b2-db91-41ab-be19-ddb068b36cc7). These rewards were previously funded by emissions of new SKY tokens.

These ongoing emissions were eliminated and replaced with a solution that funds these rewards using SKY held by the Sky Protocol.

At the same time that this new solution was implemented, SKY tokens equal to the total SKY emissions previously used to fund SKY Rewards, including the Early Bird Reward (see [A.5.3.1.1.1 - Token Distribution](eaf8cf29-90fd-4b9b-b0a8-02ce8386908c)), were burned from SKY held by the Sky Protocol.

The combination of these actions achieved a state where the number of total SKY tokens is exactly the same as if SKY Rewards had never been funded with protocol emissions.

###### A.4.1.2.2.4.2 - MKR To SKY Conversion Emissions [Core]  <!-- UUID: 676636df-729d-46e3-bf34-89d0d33e8051 -->

The legacy MKR to SKY conversion contract (Legacy Conversion Contract) burned MKR and minted new SKY. The new MKR to SKY conversion contract (New Conversion Contract) instead burns MKR and issues SKY from the existing supply of preminted SKY.

The Legacy Conversion Contract was disabled as specified in [A.4.1.2.2.4.2.1 - Disabling Legacy Conversion Contract](1b8248bf-5d88-4d67-8c4a-21981a0aa937). To offset SKY minted by the Legacy Conversion Contract after the deployment of the New Conversion Contract, an equivalent amount of preminted SKY was burned. This action ensured the total SKY token supply remains as if these specific emissions from the Legacy Conversion Contract had not occurred.

###### A.4.1.2.2.4.2.1 - Disabling Legacy Conversion Contract [Core]  <!-- UUID: 1b8248bf-5d88-4d67-8c4a-21981a0aa937 -->

The disabling of the Legacy Conversion Contract was executed in the June 26, 2025 Executive Vote.

#### A.4.4.1.2 - SKY Staking Voting Rewards [Core]  <!-- UUID: a98a1bfe-5713-43f5-a8bd-83c5808900b8 -->

The documents herein define the SKY Staking Voting Rewards. SKY stakers may choose between receiving USDS or Agent Token rewards.

##### A.4.4.1.2.1 - Sources of Voting Rewards [Core]  <!-- UUID: e1c77a6a-5b94-4d40-a205-43c703a780e2 -->

SKY stakers are eligible to receive voting rewards sourced from the Sky Treasury Management Function (TMF) or the Agent Token Distribution mechanism defined in [A.4.5 - Distribution Of Agent Tokens](e2f1f01f-3303-41c3-b337-f09eb41ba6be).

###### A.4.4.1.2.1.1 - Treasury Management Function-Derived Voting Rewards [Core]  <!-- UUID: 6cacdc1c-bdfa-4f68-bdb4-bf31943dcfba -->

USDS rewards are distributed via two distinct mechanisms based on the staker’s activity level: the High Activity Staking Reward (HASR) and the Standard Activity Staking Reward (SASR). SASR is the base reward when funding from the Treasury Management Function is available; HASR is an additional boost reserved for High-Activity wallets. See [A.2.3.1.2.3.3 - Payout From High Activity Staking Rewards Buffer](6e857f3d-1e5c-4a47-943d-439b1d0d87ea).

###### A.4.4.1.2.1.1.1 - Activity Levels [Core]  <!-- UUID: 42786ca1-42b6-4bfa-b455-54eba9e09c50 -->

At the Monthly Settlement Cycle, all SKY-staking wallets are tagged as High Activity or Standard Activity, pursuant to the criteria defined in [A.2.3.1.2.3.4 - High Activity Staker Qualification](8e83f80f-5606-41a7-bc90-d79df38b55fe) and [A.2.3.1.2.5.2.3 - Standard Activity Staker Qualification](a22d900a-d15c-41f0-af90-eec23112dcb6). Only High Activity wallets share HASR; both High and Standard Activity wallets share SASR.

###### A.4.4.1.2.1.1.2 - High Activity Staking Rewards [Core]  <!-- UUID: 40d13a7d-ddd7-42bd-ace8-05ba9ce6e588 -->

The High Activity Staking Rewards (HASR) is a boosted reward provided to High Activity wallets. The HASR amount is distributed each monthly cycle pro-rata to the SKY stake of all High Activity wallets. High Activity wallets receive SASR (when funding is available) plus their separate HASR boost.

###### A.4.4.1.2.1.1.3 - Standard Activity Staking Rewards [Core]  <!-- UUID: b18249d5-588a-44a4-8bab-250bb92b027f -->

Where their review of the proposal results in a finding of alignment with the Sky Core Atlas and Spark Artifact, and where the proposal passes review by the SRC (defined as "Passed SRC Review" in [A.6.1.1.1.3.1.4.3.1 - SRC Risk Review](968b4807-8032-42a3-b09d-f787cdb4ef87).), the Operational Facilitator next triggers a Snapshot poll to allow token holders to vote on the proposal. Token holders may vote directly or through Delegates. See [A.6.1.1.1.3.1.3 - Delegation Framework](afa6a37e-e7f1-4efb-bca7-f02bbbf5cf26). The poll is open for three (3) days. A poll must have more than 50% of votes cast, excluding abstentions, in favor to be approved.

Spark’s governance runs in a weekly cycle that begins every Monday. Upon receiving all approvals, the proposal is automatically included in the next cycle. The cut-off time is Friday 8:00 am UTC to ensure the Operational Facilitator has sufficient time to prepare the needed polls for the following Monday. After the cut-off time, it is at the discretion of the Operational Facilitator whether the proposal can be included in the immediate next cycle, or the following cycle.

The parameters specified in [A.6.1.1.1.2.6.1 - Allocation System Primitive](cd70b9f1-1a59-407c-9945-05e52bf5a3b6) and [A.6.1.1.1.3.2.1 - SparkLend](d9ff0cd2-8999-4d3d-9670-2c7b49c1fe51) will be controlled by Sky Core Governance until Sky determines that the SPK token is decentralized enough to allow for meaningful governance by tokenholders. At such time, which is currently estimated for September 17, 2025, control will transition to Spark Governance. This transitionary measure ensures better decentralization of the SPK token before Spark Governance takes full control of the named parameters under the Root Edit Primitive.

The signers of the Freezer Multisig should exercise their authority to freeze the Spark Liquidity Layer in the event that Spark is not complying with rules regarding Risk Capital or Asset Liability Management, or in the event of another emergency. The signers should consult with Ecosystem Actor Amatsu before exercising such authority, unless such consultation would cause a delay that could result in a loss of user funds or harm to Sky or Spark. Ecosystem Actor Amatsu may also ask the signers to exercise the Freezer Multisig in an emergency. The signers will work with Amatsu and, if necessary, other Ecosystem Actors, in good faith in determining whether to exercise their authority based on such request. 

Each action executed by the Freezer Multisig, including any function calls and their parameters, must be reported to the Sky community within a reasonable time frame through a post on the Sky Forum.

Modification of the signers of the Freezer Multisig must be approved through a Governance Poll; no Executive Vote is required.

The only exceptions to this are if: 1) a signer self-reports a loss of access to their private key due to any reason; or 2) a signer explicitly expresses their wish to be removed as a signer. In both cases, the signer is required to communicate the loss of access to their private key, or the wish to be removed as a signer, in the form of a public Sky Forum post. The specific signer should be replaced as soon as possible, which does not require a Governance Poll.

Any changes to the multisig signers that do not fall within the two exceptions listed above, or that have not been ratified by Sky Governance, should be questioned immediately and treated as malicious. Where malicious activity is suspected, the Governance Facilitators must prepare an expedited Executive Vote so that Sky Governance can vote on removing external security access from the multisig.

2. Variable Slope 1 - the rate at optimal utilization,

3. Variable Slope 2 - the rate at 100% utilization,

4. Utilization - the utilization itself.

The Base Rate, Slope 1, and Slope 2 parameters are further defined in: [A.6.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.13 - Base Rate Definition](9372deb9-5115-4010-bf72-34023b846525); [A.6.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.15 - Slope 1 Definition](c16b2b24-d663-4877-8bb3-cbd32e977360); and [A.6.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.17 - Slope 2 Definition](56bc7808-5ef8-42af-ba17-708b995194cc). 

All markets except Dai use this IRM. The IRM for Dai is independent of utilization and is defined as a spread over the Sky Savings Rate set forth in [A.3.1.2.2 - Sky Savings Rate](2674cccb-d779-4868-b83f-8cb86648c88a).

2. `ttl` - the cooldown period for cap increases

3. `max` - the absolute maximum exposure

Any user can permissionlessly update a covered Supply Cap or Borrow Cap so the available exposure is equal to the target, as long as the resulting exposure does not exceed the specified maximum limit and the cooldown period has elapsed in the case of increases to the Supply Cap or Borrow Cap.

The kill switch disables all borrowing across SparkLend markets in the event of a depeg on key collateral assets. 

The kill switch is defined in terms of a threshold for specified pegged assets. If the ratio of the price of a specified asset to its peg is equal to or less than the threshold, then any user can trigger the kill switch to disable borrowing across all SparkLend markets.

After the kill switch is triggered, markets can be reactivated by Sky Governance after resetting the kill switch. Resetting the kill switch is subject to the Governance Security Delay specified in [A.1.9.3 - Governance Security Delay Requirements](c5f0e955-0441-42e0-a6fc-eab875bba568).

The modification of SparkLend parameters is temporarily controlled by Sky Core, but will be transitioned to Spark in the future. Currently, the Stability Facilitators, in consultation with the Core Council Risk Advisor and Phoenix Labs, may recommend changes to any of the parameters specified in the subdocuments of [A.6.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1 - SparkLend Risk Parameters Definitions](667abf8c-64a3-4029-b218-e7a6e7000bbd) or [A.6.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.3.1 - SparkLend Risk Parameters Cap Automator Parameter Definitions](e6bc54e6-91df-4095-a032-0e1128c2cab7).

As a general rule, the modification of said parameters is pursuant to the Operational Weekly Cycle and can be effected directly via an Executive Vote, without requiring a Governance Poll. 

Changes to the parameters defined in the following documents are exceptions to the general rule and require a Governance Poll followed by an Executive Vote: 

- [A.6.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.5 - Liquidation Threshold Definition](2dd2045c-6a33-4229-b6c8-e531d6ecd27a)

Spark Protocol must pay out 10% of the income it generates from operating the borrowing and lending functionality of the protocol that is based on the Aave codebase. The documents herein define the Spark Protocol-Aave Revenue Share and its associated operational processes.

###### A.6.1.1.1.3.2.1.2.3.1 - Sky Core Governance Responsibility For Virtual Revenue Share Prior to Launch of SPK [Core]  <!-- UUID: f84a1cb6-7f77-4bd0-904f-8bf7b368d2d6 -->

Before the launch of Agent tokens, Sky Governance is temporarily responsible for paying out a "virtual revenue share" on behalf of Spark Protocol. It is calculated by taking the total amount of Dai borrowed from Spark Protocol, and then assuming a "virtual income" equivalent to 1% of this supply, and calculating a revenue share of 10% on that basis. The calculations and payments must be done manually by the Support Facilitators at the end of each quarter. 

As an example: if, before the launch of Agent tokens, 200 million Dai is borrowed on Spark Protocol, then the virtual income is 1% of 200 million Dai, which gives 2 million Dai; and of that 2 million Dai the virtual revenue share is 200,000 Dai. 

This 200,000 Dai must be paid out in incremental payments each quarter directly by Sky Governance from the Sky Surplus Buffer to a smart contract under the control of Aave Governance. If, before the launch of Agent tokens, less than 100 million Dai is borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol, accrual towards the virtual revenue share payments are paused (unpaid virtual revenue share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The virtual revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when at least 100 million Dai is again borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol. 

Once SPK tokens launch, the virtual revenue share system will be discontinued, and the standard rules of the Spark Protocol Aave Revenue Share Ecosystem Agreement shall take effect. See [A.6.1.1.1.3.2.1.2.3.2 - Standard Agreement Post SPK Launch](bb867551-5231-4a5b-ac37-09d545bf70ce).

###### A.6.1.1.1.3.2.1.2.3.2 - Standard Agreement Post SPK Launch [Core]  <!-- UUID: bb867551-5231-4a5b-ac37-09d545bf70ce -->

Post SPK launch, the following revenue-share operational process takes effect. The revenue share payment must be calculated manually at the end of each quarter by the Spark and manually paid as Dai to a smart contract under the control of Aave Governance from Spark. The payments must occur for the revenue share duration of two (2) years, starting from September 25th, 2023. 

If at any point in time after the launch of Agent tokens, Spark Protocol is generating less than 1 million Dai per year in income for Spark Agent, accrual towards the revenue share payments are paused (unpaid revenue share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when Spark Protocol is generating more than 1 million Dai per year in income again.

Spark has a pre-launch token rewards program based on the usage of its lending platform. Users of the platform will receive an airdrop of SPK tokens, depending on how much and how long they have used the platform during the pre-launch token reward period. These rewards are only for users on Ethereum Mainnet. 

There are two seasons of the Spark pre-launch token rewards: Season 1 and Season 2. 

Season 1 of pre-launch token rewards was active from August 20 2023 and lasted for nine months, ending on May 20 2024. 130,434,783 SPK tokens were allocated in this period. 

In Season 2 14,478,261 SPK will be rewarded per month to SparkLend users who qualify for the airdrop. 

Season 2 is an additional pre-farming period, which runs until the Spark Agent launches as part of Sky Endgame launch season. 

The monthly SPK rewards are allocated as follows:
◦ 80 % is allocated to users borrowing DAI and/or USDS
◦ 20 % is allocated to users supplying ETH

The proposed full anti-cheat SPK Airdrop for SparkLend is calculated using the following formula:

`Airdrop = 80% * (DAI Borrows + USDS Borrows - sDAI Supplies * sDAI Liquidation Threshold - sUSDS Supplies * sUSDS Liquidation Threshold) + 20% * (ETH Supplies - ETH Borrows / ETH Liquidation Threshold)`

All supplies and borrows are denominated in USD based on the on-chain oracle price at that block to determine the conversion.

Spark can activate a new SPK token pre-launch token reward airdrop program to capture other growth opportunities. 

The program can last until the moment SPK launches, or a shorter duration. When activated, the exact details of the special pre-launch token reward airdrop program must be specified in [A.6.1.1.1.3.2.2.2.1.1.0.6.1 - Special Pre-launch Token Reward Program Details](51316a6c-fd6a-4507-b99d-731e80fc9f76). 

The SPK tokens for the future Spark Airdrop are allocated between all borrowers based on a formula announced by Spark and specified in the above cited document. The rate of SPK tokens being earned is 7,239,130 SPK per month, distributed on a per block basis proportional to the formula specified in the above cited document.

###### A.6.1.1.1.3.4.2.1.1 - Definition [Core]  <!-- UUID: f426cc6e-336a-43bf-825d-1f0c08d1795e -->

The Encumbrance Ratio is defined as the ratio of Spark's Required Risk Capital (RRC) to Total Risk Capital (TRC), as these terms are defined in the Sky Atlas Stability Scope ([A.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1 - Encumbrance Ratio](5435f680-aaaa-461a-bcae-4056bb8964d9)). Spark will seek to maintain a Encumbrance Ratio not greater than the Target Risk Tolerance Ratio specified in [A.6.1.1.1.3.4.2.1.3 - Parameters](d65a06a6-1426-4af2-978c-cd4f7bac79b7).

###### A.6.1.1.1.3.4.2.1.2 - Operational Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: 7bc96051-ce11-4e29-aa30-b535183aeaa7 -->

Spark governance and contributors must take immediate action to reduce the Encumbrance Ratio when it exceeds the Target Encumbrance Ratio level. These actions may fall into two categories, risk capital actions or allocation system actions.

Risk capital actions are actions Spark takes to increase Total Risk Capital, including increasing Internal Junior Risk Capital, sourcing External Junior Risk Capital from other Prime Agents or tokenized sources, or sourcing External Senior Risk Capital from Sky or tokenized sources.

Allocation system actions involve adjusting the capital allocations within the Spark instance of the Allocation System to reduce Required Risk Capital, such as unwinding or disposing of assets requiring higher levels of risk capital as a percent of exposure.

The operational processes implemented at Spark will meet or exceed the requirements specified in the Sky Atlas at [A.2.2.9.1.1.3.2.1.2 - Primes’ Total Risk Capital (TRC) Management](3af8a3a2-25e5-44b3-87a4-7df1f2712685).

###### A.6.1.1.1.3.4.2.1.3 - Parameters [Core]  <!-- UUID: d65a06a6-1426-4af2-978c-cd4f7bac79b7 -->

The Enhanced Buyback Threshold defines the threshold over which the Enhanced Buyback Rate is applied to calculate buyback amounts. This variable is specified as a percentage of the Target SubDAO Proxy Value; for example, a 200% Enhanced Buyback Threshold means that the Enhanced Buyback Rate will apply to any subDAO proxy value over 2x the Target SubDAO Proxy Value.

###### A.6.1.1.1.3.4.2.3.1.5 - Buyback Executor [Core]  <!-- UUID: d6be588d-e76e-4413-8a3e-c1b59e5bd106 -->

The Buyback Executor is the entity responsible for receiving excess SubDAO Proxy funds in USDS, purchasing SPK, and returning the SPK to the Spark SubDAO Proxy. Initially, this role will be performed by the Spark Operations Multisig.

###### A.6.1.1.1.3.4.2.3.2 - Operational Process [Core]  <!-- UUID: dfa483c7-5adb-480e-9f82-c97cf4d0f74e -->

Each month, immediately following Spark’s monthly settlement with Sky, the Current SubDAO Proxy Value with be calculated based on the definition in [A.6.1.1.1.3.4.2.3.1.1 - Current SubDAO Proxy Value](9705a4be-e92f-4195-8e85-1cfe19ec1a0d), and the Target SubDAO Proxy Value based on the evaluation method in [A.6.1.1.1.3.4.2.2.2 - Evaluation Method](99d4b8da-fa5c-49ce-b93c-70d07334d7aa). If the Current SubDAO Proxy Value is greater than the Target SubDAO Proxy Value, this excess SubDAO Proxy Value is multiplied by the Standard Buyback Rate parameter up to the Enhanced Buyback Threshold, and then by the Enhanced Buyback Rate for any amount in excess of the Enhanced Buyback Threshold. The buyback amount for the month is set as the sum of the two values of the standard and enhanced buybacks.

The next available Spark proxy spell will include a transfer of this calculated buyback amount to the designated Buyback Executor. After using the transferred funds to purchase SPK, the Buyback Executor will transfer all accrued SPK to the Spark SubDAO Proxy.

If the `usdcAmount` exceeds the limit, the operator must split the swap into multiple smaller swaps as follows.
    
1. The operator must refill the PSM with DAI by calling `psm.fill()`.
    
2. The operator must recalculate the limit to see how much USDC can be swapped after the refill.
    
3. The operator must swap the maximum possible USDC amount that doesn't exceed the limit.
    
4. The operator must update `remainingUsdcToSwap` by subtracting the amount just swapped.
    
5. The operator must repeat the process until the full `usdcAmount` is swapped.

If the PSM can't be filled, the transaction reverts with `DssLitePsm/nothing-to-fill`.

`else {
    uint256 remainingUsdcToSwap = usdcAmount;

    while (remainingUsdcToSwap > 0) {
        psm.fill();

        limit = dai.balanceOf(address(psm)) / psmTo18ConversionFactor;

        uint256 swapAmount = remainingUsdcToSwap < limit ? remainingUsdcToSwap : limit;

Where their review of the proposal results in a finding of alignment with the Sky Core Atlas and Keel Artifact, the Operational Facilitator next triggers a Snapshot poll to allow token holders to vote on the proposal. The poll is open for three (3) days. A poll must have at least 10% of the circulating token supply participating and must have more than 50% of votes cast, excluding abstentions, in favor to be approved.

Only an operator with the admin role is able to set the mint recipient for a destination domain. To do so, they must call the `setMintRecipient` function on the Controller contract on mainnet providing the destination domain and the mint recipient address. Calling this function will carry out the following actions:

- The contract will confirm the admin status of the operator. If the caller does not have the admin role the transaction will revert.
- The contract will set the selected mint recipient for the specified destination domain.

- The contract will retrieve the Rate LimitData storage for the key from the data mapping.
- The contract will require that maxAmount is greater than 0, reverting with "Rate Limits/zero-maxAmount" if not.
- If maxAmount is type(uint256).max (unlimited case), the contract will return type(uint256).max without changes.
- The contract will calculate the currentRate Limit using getCurrentRate Limit.
- The contract will require that amountToDecrease is less than or equal to currentRate Limit, reverting with "Rate Limits/rate-limit-exceeded" if not.
- The contract will update lastAmount to currentRate Limit minus amountToDecrease and set lastUpdated to the current block timestamp.
- The contract will emit a Rate LimitDecreaseTriggered event with the key, amountToDecrease, currentRate Limit, and newLimit.
- The contract will return the newLimit.

The function call is as follows:

Until the Powerhouse system supports submitting Artifact Edit Proposals, SKYBASE token holders may submit Artifact Edit Proposals by posting them to the Sky Forum under the “Skybase Prime” category. The title of the post must include the text “Skybase Artifact Edit Proposal”. The post must include cryptographic proof that the author controls an account holding the required percentage of the total SKYBASE token supply specified in [A.6.1.1.4.2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1 - Root Edit Proposal Submission](f57f157c-c260-4671-8150-01acabcd286d).

Within seven (7) days of the proposal being submitted, the Operational Facilitator must review the Root Edit Proposal for alignment.

If the proposal is aligned, the Operational Facilitator must respond to the Forum post to announce their finding. In this Forum post, the Operational Facilitator must also confirm that the proposal is feasible for Operational GovOps to operationalize.

If the proposal is misaligned, the Operational Facilitator must respond to the Forum post to announce their finding and provide the reasoning for it.

Where their review of the proposal results in a finding of alignment with the Sky Core Atlas and Skybase Artifact, the Operational Facilitator next triggers a Snapshot poll to allow token holders to vote on the proposal. The poll is open for three (3) days. A poll must have at least 10% of the circulating token supply participating and must have more than 50% of votes cast, excluding abstentions, in favor to be approved.

Until the Powerhouse system supports submitting Artifact Edit Proposals, OBEX token holders may submit Artifact Edit Proposals by posting them to the Sky Forum under the "Obex Prime" category. The title of the post must include the text "Obex Artifact Edit Proposal". The post must include cryptographic proof that the author controls an account holding the required percentage of the total OBEX token supply specified in [A.6.1.1.5.2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1 - Root Edit Proposal Submission](fcb1b51e-8bb3-4a55-8cc0-9bec637086c8).

Within seven (7) days of the proposal being submitted, the Operational Facilitator must review the Root Edit Proposal for alignment.

If the proposal is aligned, the Operational Facilitator must respond to the Forum post to announce their finding. In this Forum post, the Operational Facilitator must also confirm that the proposal is feasible for Operational GovOps to operationalize.

If the proposal is misaligned, the Operational Facilitator must respond to the Forum post to announce their finding and provide the reasoning for it.

Where their review of the proposal results in a finding of alignment with the Sky Core Atlas and Obex Artifact, the Operational Facilitator next triggers a Snapshot poll to allow token holders to vote on the proposal. The poll is open for three (3) days. A poll must have at least 10% of the circulating token supply participating and must have 50% of votes in favor to be approved.

###### A.6.1.1.5.2.6.1.2.2.1.3.2 - Set Rate Limit Data [Core]  <!-- UUID: 993bbc35-1692-4c1b-87b2-de5997e90bf5 -->

Only an operator with the admin role is able to set or update rate limit data for a specific key, including maxAmount, slope, and historical values. There are two overloads for flexibility. Calling these functions will carry out the following actions:

- The contract will require that lastAmount is less than or equal to maxAmount, reverting with "Rate Limits/invalid-lastAmount" if not.

- The contract will require that lastUpdated is less than or equal to the current block timestamp, reverting with "Rate Limits/invalid-lastUpdated" if not.

- The contract will store the provided data in the _data mapping as a Rate LimitData struct.

- The contract will emit a Rate LimitDataSet event with the key and provided values.

The function calls are as follows:

`function setRate LimitData(bytes32 key, uint256 maxAmount, uint256 slope, uint256 lastAmount, uint256 lastUpdated) public override onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)

function setRate LimitData(bytes32 key, uint256 maxAmount, uint256 slope) external override`

Only an operator with the admin role is able to set unlimited rate limit data for a specific key by configuring it with maximum values. Calling this function will carry out the following actions:

- The contract will call setRate LimitData internally with type(uint256).max for maxAmount and lastAmount, 0 for slope, and the current block timestamp for lastUpdated.

The function call is as follows:

`function setUnlimitedRate LimitData(bytes32 key) external override`

###### A.6.1.1.5.2.6.1.2.2.1.3.4 - Get Current Rate Limit [Core]  <!-- UUID: f629bb8f-afb2-4bfc-b7fa-3f5fbaa2c2f9 -->

Anyone can query the current rate limit value for a specific key, accounting for time-based slope accrual. Calling this function will carry out the following actions:

- The contract will retrieve the Rate LimitData for the key from the _data mapping.

- If maxAmount is type(uint256).max (unlimited case), the contract will return type(uint256).max.

- Otherwise, the contract will calculate and return the minimum of (slope * time elapsed since lastUpdated + lastAmount) and maxAmount.

The function call is as follows:

`function getCurrentRate Limit(bytes32 key) public override view returns (uint256)`

###### A.6.1.1.5.2.6.1.2.2.1.3.5 - Trigger Rate Limit Decrease [Core]  <!-- UUID: 2fc640dc-1f48-4167-a700-cb54f2cb1097 -->

Only an operator with the controller role can trigger a decrease in the rate limit for a specific key by a given amount. Calling this function will carry out the following actions:

- The contract will retrieve the Rate LimitData storage for the key from the data mapping.

- The contract will require that maxAmount is greater than 0, reverting with "Rate Limits/zero-maxAmount" if not.

- If maxAmount is type(uint256).max (unlimited case), the contract will return type(uint256).max without changes.

- The contract will calculate the currentRate Limit using getCurrentRate Limit.

- The contract will require that amountToDecrease is less than or equal to currentRate Limit, reverting with "Rate Limits/rate-limit-exceeded" if not.

- The contract will update lastAmount to currentRate Limit minus amountToDecrease and set lastUpdated to the current block timestamp.

- The contract will emit a Rate LimitDecreaseTriggered event with the key, amountToDecrease, currentRate Limit, and newLimit.

- The contract will return the newLimit.

The function call is as follows:

`function triggerRate LimitDecrease(bytes32 key, uint256 amountToDecrease) external override onlyRole(CONTROLLER) returns (uint256 newLimit)`
