This approach allows the rule's exact wording, even if flawed or misaligned with its goals, to dictate the result, particularly if it benefits the interpreter.</p><p>A "spirit of the rule" interpretation seeks to comprehend the rule's true purpose and how it contributes to Universal Alignment, while remaining bound by the letter of the rule. When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule's language, this approach appeals to a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Imagine a large corporation discovers a loophole in the environmental regulation of its jurisdiction that allows them to generate profits by using a specific type of pollutant that isn't regulated as a greenhouse gas, but is as harmful as regulated greenhouse gasses.</p><p>By exploiting the "letter of the rule," the corporation complies with the regulations on paper but continues to harm the environment and public health in practice.</p><p>A universally aligned actor, such as an environmentally conscious competitor, would interpret the regulations based on their "spirit" or underlying purpose - protecting the environment and public health. Recognizing that exploiting the loophole contradicts the regulations' intent, the universally aligned actor would voluntarily choose not to emit the harmful pollutant, even though doing so might be profitable and technically legal. A universally aligned actor would also actively work with the government and other stakeholders to close the loophole and strengthen the regulations to ensure that they effectively serve their intended purpose, and to protect themselves from misaligned competitors.</p></td>

Weak comment types are highly mutable, as they can often be edited or deleted without a public trace, and may not be visible to all ecosystem participants (e.g., requiring platform-specific accounts or access to private channels). They also have low resistance to compromise, relying on accounts without strong security protocols, making them vulnerable to malicious edits or takeovers by bad actors.

Strong comment provenance types are considered easy to modify by the commenting party, hence why they possess lower legitimacy than document provenance types.

          <td>Executive Votes operate under a Continuous Approval Voting mechanism. Voters can support multiple proposals by allocating their SKY vote-weight to each, with the goal of helping a favored proposal surpass the current "hat"—the proposal with the most approval in the DSChief contract. Voters can apply their full SKY vote-weight to up to 5 different proposals simultaneously (as defined by the <code>max_yays</code> limit in the contract), rather than splitting their tokens between them. If SKY token holders disagree with a new proposal, they can redirect their SKY vote-weight to the inactive proposal with the highest vote-weight (often the last successfully passed proposal) to maintain the status quo or support an alternative. An active proposal can become the hat if it accumulates more votes than any other, including the current hat, at which point it is "lifted" to become the new hat. This lifting process marks the active proposal, and it may now be scheduled and later executed, provided it meets other conditions like the GSM Pause Delay. There are three key aspects to Continuous Approval Voting:
            <ul>
              <li>Victory threshold set by the hat: The vote-weight on the current hat proposal establishes the "victory threshold" that new proposals must exceed to become eligible for execution. This ensures only the most supported changes advance.</li>
              <li>Dynamic vote-weight movement: Vote-weight can shift from the hat to a new proposal, simultaneously lowering the victory threshold for the hat while boosting the new proposal's chances. This fluidity allows for real-time community consensus shifts.</li>
              <li>Securing the hat: Vote-weight is encouraged to remain on the hat proposal even after it's lifted, acting as a security measure against "rogue" or less-supported proposals that might attempt to overtake it with minimal backing.</li>

            In the long term, Operational GovOps calculates the Distribution Reward for each month. Operational GovOps then pays the Distribution Reward recipient from its Buffer. Later Sky Core reimburses the Operational Agent Buffer for the amount paid as part of the Settlement Cycle. This minimizes the role of Sky Core in Distribution Reward payments and emphasizes the primary role of the Operational Executor Agent, acting through Operational GovOps, in implementing the Sky Primitives.

See <dfn>A.3.3 - Total Risk Capital Sourcing Ratios</dfn>.</p><p>The system must provide real-time or near real-time tracking of all held Total Risk Capital (TRC) components. This includes, for each TRC component:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Accurate valuation of the assets comprising each component.</li>
                  <li>Clear identification of the source of each component (e.g., Prime's own SubProxy for IJRC, specific Ecosystem Accord references for rented PEJRC or OSRC, TEJRC encumbrance details, OSRC origination details).</li>
                  <li>Verification of each TRC component's eligibility status according to Atlas rules. This includes tracking whether capital is "enabled" or "active" for RRC coverage purposes (e.g., based on Ecosystem Accord status, compliance with sourcing ratios, etc.).</li>
                  <li>Distinction between capital directly held by the Prime Agent and capital that is encumbered (e.g., PEJRC where the lending Prime retains custody but the capital is contractually committed).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Prime Agents' internal TRC management systems should enable dynamic-state accounting. The system must account for TRC components that are in dynamic, pending, or off-chain states, as these can impact the true risk capital available to a Prime Agent. This includes:
                <ul>
                  <li>Pending transactions such as PEJRC or OSRC rental Ecosystem Accords that have been committed to by the parties, but not yet codified in the Atlas.</li>
                  <li>Capital in transit, e.g., assets that are committed to be IJRC, but currently moving between chains via bridges or locked in Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) messages awaiting finality.</li>
                  <li>Operational expenditures funded by TRC components (typically IJRC), such as blockchain transaction fees, oracle service fees, audit costs, and other operational overhead that reduces available risk capital. The system should track these expenditures in real-time or near real-time.</li>
                  <li>Any off-chain factors that could impair the immediate deployability or availability of TRC components.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Prime Agents' internal TRC management systems should enable continuous capital adequacy monitoring. The system must enable the near real-time comparison of the Prime Agent's internally tracked and calculated TRC against its official Aggregate RRC, as obtained from the Sky Core RRC Dashboard/API. See <dfn>A.2.4 - Sky Core Required Risk Capital (RRC) Dashboard And API</dfn>. This core functionality is essential for the Prime Agent to proactively monitor its capital adequacy, identify potential or actual TRC shortfalls, and make timely operational and capital management decisions to maintain compliance.</li>
              <li><p>Prime Agents' internal TRC management systems should define a RRC-incident (e.g., TRC shortfall) response protocol. The system should enable internal alerting mechanisms that detect when a Prime Agent's TRC approaches predefined internal buffer thresholds relative to its Aggregate RRC. See <dfn>A.3.3 - Encumbrance Ratio</dfn>. The system should also detect an actual shortfall where the Prime Agent's held TRC falls below its Aggregate RRC.</p><p>Furthermore, Prime Agent teams should establish and document internal processes for responding to such alerts. Such internal processes should include:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>internal escalation and assessment of the shortfall's cause and magnitude;</li>
                  <li>formulation of potential responses or corrective actions, which may include sourcing additional TRC, reducing risk-weighted exposures, or other measures;</li>
                  <li>internal decision-making framework for the evaluation of potential responses and selection of the most appropriate one; and</li>
                  <li>notifying any pertinent parties (Operational GovOps) as needed for the purpose of planning or implementing follow-up action.</li>
                </ol>
              Prime Agent teams' internal decision-making framework may consider the economic trade-offs of various actions, including the strategic acceptance of penalties for a TRC shortfall where such an approach is determined to be economically advantageous compared to immediate rebalancing (e.g., avoiding excessive transaction costs or market impact).</li>

          <td><p>Prime Agents are required to periodically submit TRC Reports to Core GovOps. This report serves a dual purpose. It provides a verifiable snapshot of the Prime Agent's TRC composition and key capital ratios as of the end of the reporting period; and second, it provides a formal attestation regarding the Prime Agent's maintenance of TRC at or above its dynamically changing Aggregate Required Risk Capital (RRC) throughout the entire reporting period. See <dfn>A.3.3 - Aggregate RRC</dfn>.</p><p>This comprehensive reporting, encompassing both an end-of-period statement and disclosures of any intra-period events affecting TRC, is essential. On-chain data alone (such as that captured by the planned OVRC system) cannot definitively prove the full eligibility and unimpaired availability of a Prime Agent's capital position for continuous RRC coverage, nor can it capture all off-chain factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether assets are subject to Prime-initiated off-chain contractual pledges, if the economic value or redeemability of its bridged assets is compromised by issues with their originating bridge, or if its assets are encumbered by derivative structures or other off-chain commitments that would impair their immediate use at any point during the period.</p><p>The TRC Report serves as an important basis for Core GovOps' verification procedures. This entails: 1) reconciling reported end-of-period TRC components against the Sky Atlas, on-chain data, and other relevant sources to validate the period-end capital position and adherence to Atlas-defined capital requirements; and 2) reviewing Prime Agents' attestations and disclosures regarding its TRC management and any material events throughout the reporting period to assess continuous compliance with its dynamically changing Aggregate RRC. The outcome of this validation is a critical input for the monthly settlement cycles, which latter includes the determination and retroactive application of penalties for any identified discrepancies or violations of capital requirements during the period.</p><p>The long-term vision is for the Powerhouse system to enable the automation of TRC data aggregation and verification. The Powerhouse system will have capabilities such as directly querying Prime Agent SubProxy accounts for IJRC assets, programmatically accessing and interpreting Ecosystem Accords recorded in the Atlas, interfacing with TEJRC and OSRC smart contract systems, and automatically applying Atlas-defined eligibility rules. See <dfn>A.2.4 - Continuous Monitoring Of On-chain Verifiable Risk Capital (OVRC)</dfn>. Even in this advanced state, the TRC Report, or a similar form of periodic attestation, may remain necessary to cover elements of TRC verification that are not fully able to be automated or require explicit Prime Agent declaration.</p></td>

The effective yield is defined as: (Total Market Value of Distributed SKY Tokens / Total Eligible USDS Balance).</p><p>To achieve this normalization, the quantity of SKY token rewards to be distributed is determined through the following calculation, performed for each normalization period:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Determine Target Reward Value: Calculate the total US dollar value required to meet the SSR for the period: (Total Eligible USDS Balance * SSR).</li>

          </ol>
          The Core Facilitator, on the recommendation of the Core Council Risk Advisor, may maintain the quantity of SKY token rewards to be distributed for a normalization period at its current level if they conclude that:
          <ul>
            <li>the difference between the effective yield provided by SKY Tokens Rewards and the SSR is not material;</li>
            <li>the difference between the effective yield provided by SKY Token Rewards and the SSR is unlikely to persist due to other factors; or</li>
            <li>adjusting the quantity of SKY Token Rewards is otherwise inadvisable.</li>

          The recommendation of the Core Council Risk Advisor must be posted to the Sky Forum.

The examples should not contradict their Target Document or other Supporting Documents of the Target Document.If the Action Tenet can be anchored to a specific term from the Target Document, that term is listed first; followed by a hyphen; and then, an abstract of the Action Tenet logic, e.g.: "Organizational Drift - ACs' Mandate When Instigating Action Can Be Traced Back to a Discrete Entity". If the Action Tenet cannot be anchored to a specific term from the Target Document, the "Name" property should simply summarize the Action Tenet logic, e.g.: "Evaluating AC breach of role-specific requirement vs. general requirement".</p></td>

This includes driving adoption of USDS and deploying collateral backing USDS at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Spark does this through the Spark Liquidity Layer, SparkLend, and Spark Savings.- The Spark Liquidity Layer directly provides USDS, sUSDS, and USDC liquidity across networks and DeFi markets.- SparkLend is a lending market focused on USDS borrowing, sourcing liquidity directly from Sky to provide the best borrow rates for USDS.- Spark Savings enables stablecoin holders to earn the best risk-adjusted rate in DeFi, at large scale, with minimal liquidity constraints.</td>

          <td>Before the launch of Agent tokens, Sky Governance is temporarily responsible for paying out a "virtual revenue share" on behalf of Spark Protocol. It is calculated by taking the total amount of Dai borrowed from Spark Protocol, and then assuming a "virtual income" equivalent to 1% of this supply, and calculating a revenue share of 10% on that basis. The calculations and payments must be done manually by the Support Facilitators at the end of each quarter. As an example: if, before the launch of Agent tokens, 200 million Dai is borrowed on Spark Protocol, then the virtual income is 1% of 200 million Dai, which gives 2 million Dai; and of that 2 million Dai the virtual revenue share is 200,000 Dai. This 200,000 Dai must be paid out in incremental payments each quarter directly by Sky Governance from the Sky Surplus Buffer to a smart contract under the control of Aave Governance. If, before the launch of Agent tokens, less than 100 million Dai is borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol, accrual towards the virtual revenue share payments are paused (unpaid virtual revenue share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The virtual revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when at least 100 million Dai is again borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol. Once SPK tokens launch, the virtual revenue share system will be discontinued, and the standard rules of the Spark Protocol Aave Revenue Share Ecosystem Agreement shall take effect. See <dfn>Standard Agreement Post SPK Launch</dfn>.</td>

These rewards are only for users on Ethereum Mainnet. There are two seasons of the Spark pre-launch token rewards: Season 1 and Season 2. Season 1 of pre-launch token rewards was active from August 20 2023 and lasted for nine months, ending on May 20 2024. 130,434,783 SPK tokens were allocated in this period. In Season 2 14,478,261 SPK will be rewarded per month to SparkLend users who qualify for the airdrop. Season 2 is an additional pre-farming period, which runs until the Spark Agent launches as part of Sky Endgame launch season. The monthly SPK rewards are allocated as follows:◦ 80 % is allocated to users borrowing DAI and/or USDS◦ 20 % is allocated to users supplying ETHThe proposed full anti-cheat SPK Airdrop for SparkLend is calculated using the following formula:Airdrop = 80% * (DAI Borrows + USDS Borrows - sDAI Supplies * sDAI Liquidation Threshold - sUSDS Supplies * sUSDS Liquidation Threshold) + 20% * (ETH Supplies - ETH Borrows / ETH Liquidation Threshold)All supplies and borrows are denominated in USD based on the on-chain oracle price at that block to determine the conversion.</td>
